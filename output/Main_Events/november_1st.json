        "synopsis": "Maya , exhausted by Ayane 's recent obsession with her, points out how much time has passed since they agreed to talk with Sensei . With Christmas now looming, and Ayane's mental state still abysmal, Maya requests a 'break' from the constant attention, but Ayane rejects her request, as well as her accusation that she's secretly into her. She's left further upset by Maya's indifference to Sensei's condition and her disregard of Ami 's sudden shift in behavior. Holding out hope, she begs Maya to come along with her to Sensei's house to, once again, try and get permission to see him. This suggestion is received poorly, with Maya believing it will be as unsuccessful as the other attempts. Ayane concedes that the possibility is likely, but that so long as she isn't sure he hasn't been wiped out like 'Maya-Prime', she can't rest. The insinuation that she is 'sub-prime' offends Maya slightly, but she begrudgingly agrees to go with Ayane's plan, on the condition they leave immediately once rejected. Ayane thanks her and apologizes for hurting her feelings. Time passes and the girls immediately head for the Residential District, unlocking Sensei's front door and finding the place seemingly empty. While Maya's ready to give up immediately, Ayane decides to try and sneak into Sensei's room before Ami discovers them. The two don't get far, though, as Ami soon swoops in, demanding an answer for their sudden, unannounced visit. Ayane insists they're worried about Sensei, suggesting they take him to a hospital if he's been despondent for so long. Ami's insulted by the insinuation that she's unable to take care of the situation herself and suggests Ayane's merely trying to ruin her attempts at helping Sensei recover. Ayane insists this isn't true, but is left speechless by Ami's proceeding questions, each one progressively morbid and prying. Feeling increasingly hopeless, Ayane begs for permission to see Sensei, trying to express how worried she is at how stagnant both he and Ami herself seemingly are. Ami's furious with this line of reasoning, and refuses to budge, threatening to call the police should either Ayane or Maya step foot into their house again. Stepping in, Maya asks if they can leave a message for Sensei instead, with Ami agreeing to pass it along depending on its contents. After hearing Ayane's message, Ami realizes just how little trust she seems to have in her. She wonders aloud if both girls think she's merely obsessed and locking Sensei away due to untempered obsession. Ami confesses that such a possibility is likely, but feels she's allowed to be so mentally unstable due to how awful her life's been. Before either girl can react to this declaration, Ami demands they leave immediately. A knock on the door breaks up this conversation, and in walks Noriko and Niki , a duo Ami passive-aggressively proclaims did announce their arrival ahead of time. Upon seeing both Nakayama sisters, Maya immediately leaves, prompting brief confusion from Niki which is quickly pushed aside. Niki takes the time to drop off some Christmas presents for both Ami and Sensei, while Noriko tries to comfort Ayane, seeing how obviously upset she is.",
