Ami doesn't like Ayane's talk of being in love with Sensei, and although Ayane promises to tone it down, her comments keep making Ami more and more suspicious. In the end, Ayane is willing to promise that she won't do anything with Sensei â€” but only if Ami admits that she likes Sensei \"that way\" too, which she refuses to do. Maya stays out of it.",
