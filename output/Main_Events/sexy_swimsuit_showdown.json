        "synopsis": "With Ayane , Ami , Yasu , and Touka heading out into the forest, the class begins getting ready for the following swimsuit contest. After Wakana steals the show for a moment, everyone present gathers around the commentary table as both Kirin and Karin take up the mics. While Kirin is incredibly enthused about tonight's competition, Karin struggles to push past her embarrassment â€“ During the sister's commentary, Wakana catches wind of the contest's focus, marches over to Imani and Sensei and, after confirming the contest with both of them, berates both of them. Before she's able to put a stop to it, though, Kirin hurriedly calls the first contestant to the stage. As Chika takes the stage, the Kanda sister both ask her a variety of questions, with Kirin intentionally probing once Chika begins slinging insults. Karin, meanwhile, struggles to fight back against her sister's mischievousness, often interjecting awkwardly. Chika's turn comes to an end once she starts fighting with Kirin about the answer to her third question. The audience members all stand around, each being at different levels of uncomfortable. Among the ones watching are Otoha , Rin , and Futaba , who all express their opinions on the unstable commentary. Sana soon joins them, still recovering from her earlier talk . The three express concern once it becomes apparent Sana's not feeling well, but she refuses to talk about it and gets them to drop the topic. Having finished yelling at Chika, Kirin introduces Uta onto the stage, with Karin immediately stepping in to try and prevent another mess. Her attempt is quickly foiled once Kirin begins her line of questioning though, but Uta plays along with her first question since it gives her an advantage. Uta only ends up pausing uncomfortably when Karin asks about the most embarrassing incident in her life, but she ultimately manages to answer it by using her first big mistake as a maid. Her last question is what her idea of a perfect date is, and, after her attempt to make a cop-out is shut down, she sees cuddling at home as an ideal date. Kirin asks another question to get a more interesting answer, but Uta decides to stay silent and gets embarrassed, which ends with her revealing that she's the one who thought up this contest. This prompts Kirin to pry and tease her about her true intentions for doing so, but Karin puts her foot down when her comments and demands get more embarrassing and tells Kirin to end the contest. Realizing how serious her sister is, Kirin does as she's told. Wakana storms up to Sensei and Imani, immediately tearing into the former for letting his students organize this sort of contest. She reminds him of his position, both professionally and in life, and advises him to seek out Imani if he craves attention. Imani's embarrassed by this assertion and even more so when Wakana reveals that they have been betting on when she'll become closer to Sensei, something that was started by Rika . Imani decides to give her a call, Wakana wants to forget this ever happened, and Sensei makes his way to the girls to announce the winner. Once he meets up with them, both contestants assure him that they'll accept his verdict, and while Sensei knows they're lying, he still chooses one of them, with the winner being surprised that he picked them. After a short talk with the winner, Sensei is called over by Imani, who received a food delivery from Rika as compensation for embarrassing her.",
