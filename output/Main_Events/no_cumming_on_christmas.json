        "synopsis": "Yasu walks up to Sana and Ayane , staring intently at Sana and trying to pry into her hidden feelings. Her unrelenting stare and cryptic questioning make the two girls nervous, but it’s as Yasu tells Sana to ‘free herself’ that Sana finally buckles and runs off to be alone. Ayane tries to chastise Yasu for being so rude, but she seems confused, seemingly having forgotten the whole exchange. As Ayane tries to excuse herself to find Sana, Yasu stops her, telling her that she has to stay if they want to avoid tragedy. Ayane questions what she means, but Yasu’s only able to give a cryptic warning that they’ll be forced back if they don’t listen. Ayane starts to feel uneasy as Yasu’s words get increasingly unnerving. Back on the shore, Uta walks up to Sensei , who’s been looking for Ami after abandoning ‘Ami time’ earlier . Uta remarks that Ami must still be his favorite if she has a timeslot named after her, but Sensei dismisses the idea and insists he’d spend his life in ‘Uta time’ if given the chance. She’s embarrassed by this idea and as Sensei pushes the idea further, the conversation ends up with his misbehavior during his last visit , where he hurts her feelings by accidentally bringing up her past with a light-hearted comment. Uta changes the topic to their Christmas party. He decides to not embarrass her further since he intents to consider the girl’s feelings, but decides to abandon that idea and just press them forward, though he realizes that he can’t anymore. Both discuss everything that’s happened recently until Sensei wants to know why Io isn’t with her, with Uta remarking that she’s gone off alone since she doesn’t enjoy swimming. Sensei offers to help find her, but Uta instead says they should spend more time alone. Sensei asks her if she’s coming on to him right now, but when Uta tries to retaliate the same way, he abuses an accidental slip of the tongue on her part to further embarrass her. She declares that nothing like this is going to happen, but Sensei knows that it will. At that moment, Io runs in on Sana.",
