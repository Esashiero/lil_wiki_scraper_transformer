        "synopsis": "Sensei spends another afternoon in his office, but this time Noriko and Rin are standing in front of him in complete silence. He decides to sacrifice one of them, making the chosen one happy as they bet on which name he would call first. With that out of the way, they explain that they don’t attend the club today so Otoha can teach Sana without them getting in the way. They are a little bit worried that Chika is still there and could annoy her, but they think that someone with her social skill can read the room just fine. Sensei is more worried about Sana, knowing that she’s bad in social situation with unfamiliar people – and a scene transition proofs that these worries are justified as Sana is overwhelmed by her lesson. Otoha does her best to teach and encourage her while Chika suggests to let her play to a song rather than a metronome, causing a light argument about appropriate teaching methods, which gets interrupted when Rika enters and asks where Rin is. At first, Chika doesn’t recognize her, but she remembers seeing her with Rin during middle school and asks if she’s one of her moms, which she confirms. Otoha takes the opportunity to introduce herself as Rin’s girlfriend, and while Chika tries to insert herself into the conversation, she leaves when she notices that she’s in the way. Rika fears that Rin will be angry with her for meeting her too soon, but Otoha thinks it will be fine since Rin wants her to meet her parents for a long time, accidentally causing Rika to have an emotional breakdown. Back in Sensei’s office, he has to listen to Noriko teaching him about vegetarianism and complains about her trying to convert him when she only wants to educate him. Suddenly, Rin notices from her texts with Chika that something is off and storms out of Sensei’s office without an explanation. Noriko hopes that Sensei doesn’t take advantage of their sudden privacy, but he knows that she wouldn’t let him do anything. Noriko asks him about Halloween and he brings up their conversation at the party and wonders if something like his will happen again, but she wants to avoid another situation like that. On that note, she shifts the conversation to his relationship with Niki , because she knows everything form her point of view but wants to understand why her letters didn’t rekindle his love for her. The only relationship he wants to discuss with her is theirs, though, and wants to know when she's ready for the next step. She thinks that she will be after Halloween as she feels incredibly hot as of late. Meanwhile, Rin reached the club room and isn’t happy about Rika being there and is even less pleased to learn that she applied at her school to become their club adviser. Rika reminds her that they still need one for the club to continue and thinks that having someone like her, who has experience in playing instruments, would be beneficial for them. Both of them start to banter until Otoha asks Rin why she kept her parents break-up a secret and she explains that she learned about it recently and was still trying to process it. Otoha thinks that they should talk once the club is over, but Rika suggest they do it now to deal with their issues immediately and takes over Sana’s lesson. Rin wants to talk with her mother as well and she promises that they will while eating a pepperoni pizza later.",
