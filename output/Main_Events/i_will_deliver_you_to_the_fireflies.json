        "synopsis": "As Sensei makes his way to Maya , he starts to blackout, rambling to himself until he finds her and feels normal once again. She clarifies that the only reason she wanted to speak to him was to chastise him for being so insensitive, but is stopped in her tracks when he confesses that he chooses her over a night with Noriko . He takes a seat next to her, as she admits that she didn’t just want to reprimand him, which he admits he knew. She’s still angry that he bailed on their date yesterday , which he apologizes for, but excuses himself by saying that yesterday was weird for him, mentioning that Tsuneyo may be aware of the reset. Maya is surprised to hear this, but when Sensei tells her that she feels like everything runs in circles , she doesn't thinks that this is a lead; Yumi ’s situation, however, where she has no or contradictory memories of the last two months , sounds more promising to her since she knows that Yumi was talking with Sensei when the time skip happened . She’s surprised to find out that Sensei didn’t simply spend his time being a lecher and actually took some time to learn more about their situation, but remains confused as to why Tsuneyo and Yumi would be receptive to the reset, considering that both aren’t particularly close to Sensei. The conversation flows onto Ayane and Maya’s cold war with each other, with Maya saying that them being suspicious of each other is inevitable given the situation. Maya views Ayane as a ‘glitch’ that needs to be corrected while Ayane thinks Maya wants Sensei to herself. Sensei thinks the latter is plausible since he’s still convinced that she loves him, to which Maya asks him why he brings it up again when he knows that she can’t talk about it. Sensei flat-out confesses his love for her as an answer, sending her into a state of shock. She forces him to confess again and can’t believe that his brain doesn’t short-circuit as a result, because so far it always ended with him being erased. Sensei asks her to try confessing to him, but when she’s too scared to try it, he suggests a non-verbal confession instead. While hesitant at first and chastising him further, she still gets closer to his face, ready to find him again if the world ends right now. Just before their lips can connect, Touka walks in on them and apologizes for interrupting their moment once she realizes what’s going on. Maya and Sensei awkwardly try to bury the situation, though Touka isn’t convinced but assures them that she won’t tell anyone. Touka informs them that she got Sensei for the gift exchange and needs him to follow her to her limousine to receive it. Sensei doesn’t think that he can right now, but Maya says that she wants to take a platonic walk on the beach before making a hasty exit. With her gone, Sensei agrees to follow Touka, not sure if her timing was perfect or awful.",
