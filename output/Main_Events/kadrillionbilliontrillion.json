When Sensei returns from his meeting with Makoto (whom he claims was feeling ill), Ami asks him to deal with the situation. First, though, he wishes Yumi a happy birthday — she asks if he is \"back to normal now\". Sensei talks to Molly, who is starting to make suggestive comments about being \"ready to go\" in more ways than one, but before they decide what to do with her, Sensei gets a call from Haruka . She's drunk too, and tells him that she and Maki need him to come fix their pipes. Sensei tells the girls that duty calls.",
