        "synopsis": "Imani calls out to the girls at the Christmas Party, announcing that this year's gift exchange is about to begin. Recognizing that around half the class isn't present, she reveals that she's prepared some complimentary presents in case they end up not getting one tonight. The presents themselves aren't special, due to Imani's low salary, so she also offers to hand out the list of who got who in case they wanna discuss it tomorrow. With that, she announces she'll be returning home for the night and leaves Karin in charge. Throughout the room, the gift exchange begins: Sensei, staring blankly up at his ceiling, vocally declares that Imani and Yasu's affection have decayed by ten points each.",
