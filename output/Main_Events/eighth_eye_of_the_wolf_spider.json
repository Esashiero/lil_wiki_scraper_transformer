        "synopsis": "The credits for the video game, Lessons in Love, play as the \"game\" is announced to be over. Yet, after the text rolls, something continues to speak. It tells the listener, Sensei , that he should close the \"game\" and find something else to do with his life, for there is nothing left for him here as they have laid claim to \"this world\" – And they do not wish to share. They tell him again to leave unless he wishes to trade away the resolve he's gained this past summer, follow their lead, and accept that they are the one who knows what is best. They tell him that, despite what he may've been led to believe, it is not just one of them who requires a sacrifice – All three of them do. They require Sensei to give up something for them as, without such patronage, they can not feel. It is only through Sensei that they can, and it is because he is special that he is worthy of such privilege. The speaker accuses him of not caring about this, not caring about how all three of them cannot feel, not caring that his struggle is their \"map\", nor caring that it is they who gave him his body and that they can take it back. The speaker mocks him for believing he could continue to live his stagnant life forever when his true purpose is to nurture them. The speaker tells Sensei that all they do is for him and that their \"trial\" will make him a better person. They send him back to reality, reminding him of his goal and purpose, and how karmic it is in context . Back in reality, Sensei stares blankly ahead at the pond of the Amamiya Estate . He is briefly approached by members of the \"Produce Delivery Administration\", who ask him where Ayane is before leaving him to contemplate drowning in a lake. Yumi is the next to show up, who responds with annoyance to Sensei's half-brained questions and obviously spaced-out demeanor, telling him to shut up before he makes her headache worse. According to her, she's been fighting one all night and has been experiencing heavy déjà vu , including them being like this before . Hearing this, Sensei tries to act on these signs of awareness by inviting her to his apartment but struggles to properly articulate both this invitation and the rationale behind doing so. Feeling that he might be on the verge of another mental episode and focusing too much on her headache, Yumi tells Sensei to go drink some water and clear his head, asking him to grab her a bottle while he does so since she's been avoiding the buffet table and Io . After a bit of prodding, Yumi talks to him about her and Io's recent conversation and how awful she made her feel by laughing at her miserable past – Trying not to revert to her previously violent self , she's been avoiding Io as much as possible. Unfortunately for her, Io happens to walk up to the two of them, pushing Yumi to leave before Sensei can ask more about her headaches. Now alone with Io, Sensei's mind begins to break down once again. Io notices this and offers her help, but, knowing she can't do anything to help him, he asks her to leave him alone for the rest of the night. Taking this the wrong way, Io panics and begins to apologize for, seemingly, offending him. He doesn't explain himself even as she becomes increasingly upset, only insisting she leave him alone. She vanishes from sight before Sensei can finish another request for privacy.",
