        "synopsis": "It's the day of Nodoka 's transfer, and Sensei assumes her introduction will be a normal one, considering that she's rather normal herself when she isn't talking about her interests and can't possibly have a weirder introduction than Uta . After being told that Yumi isn't there, Nodoka decides to skip her part and makes her introduction by giving her opinion on a quote regarding love from Natsumi Soseki. Makoto is surprised to see a normal introduction for once, and it's revealed that Wakana is in the room as well, because Nodoka asked for her presence. Once Wakana is dismissed by Sensei, Nodoka decides to copy another introduction and intends to announce her feelings to her true love. While everyone braces themselves for what she has to say, she reveals her feelings for Futaba , which causes different reactions from the girls. Sensei finally asks her to wrap up her introduction to end the chaos she created, but Makoto asks for his attention before he succeeds. Makoto informs him that Otoha 's transfer is almost finalized, only requiring his signature to finish the process, and, despite him having already more students than the school thinks he can handle, two more girls will be transferred into his class afterwards, both requiring special care. The first one is the daughter of the richest family in Kumon-mi, who's supposed to get everything she asks for and was apparently put into his care by the request of her mother, with Sensei assuming it's Tsubasa 's oldest daughter , which he confirms by asking Chika for Tsubasa's family name. He also wants to know about the second girl, but Makoto has next to no information on her, partly because the entries in her student file are either incomplete or outdated, partly because all of her former teachers hung up on her the moment she mentioned the student's name. All she knows is that her name is Yasu Yasui and that she requires special care. Lacking further information, Sensei suggests they wait for her arrival to see why she needs it. With this out of the way, Sensei decides to take a nap, but Makoto requests his presence for an inspection of the beach inn they will visit during the next class trip. While she notices an anomaly in the timeline, it's quickly corrected by the world and Sensei agrees to accompany her, with Makoto suggesting he calls her whenever he's ready.",
