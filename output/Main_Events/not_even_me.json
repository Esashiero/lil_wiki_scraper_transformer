        "synopsis": "Walking through the school hallways after a later day than usual, Sensei reflects on the three weeks he's been in this world, what his purpose, and what the things around him ultimately mean. After lamenting the total lack of people in the school at the very late hour, the world glitches, and he wonders what his role in the grand scheme is. He wanders outside and into an alleyway, contemplating the opening and closing of doors in his path and what he can do to make some himself, and his attention is captured by Yumi , standing off to the side. Yumi seems more talkative than usual, and the two trade questions on why the other is in an alleyway in the middle of the night, but as Sensei is about to head home and leave Yumi to her business, she calls out to him. She asks why his attitude toward everything in general, but her specifically has changed so drastically, and before he can reply, she tells him to go back to the old Sensei if it'll keep him from wandering around in the dead of night. Yumi talks to him about how he's acted, and Sensei is surprised with Yumi's sudden bluntness, leading to Yumi almost rumbling his real secret, before she tells him to \"stop it\". The two talk about philosophical stuff for a moment, before Yumi dismisses the conversation. Sensei tells her to head to the dorms and get some rest, and he himself leaves to do the same.",
