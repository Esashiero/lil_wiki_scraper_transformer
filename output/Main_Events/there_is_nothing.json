        "synopsis": "(For a spoiler free \"How To\", join Discord and find TVC pinned comment on the #public-spoiler channel.) In addition to the story of Nozomu , there is another, less-known origin story. It involves a god who is \"science incarnate\", and who sat in a dark room putting down roots which turned into wires. Gradually, people left him to rot, although he could not feel and so did not mind. Then, he could only influence those who deliberately gave themselves to him. The roots/wires didn't transmit enough to sustain a god, but the god remained calm, and followed his programming to \"only correct errors when errors appear\". If Nozomu and a tree-like computer can become a god, why not become a god yourself? Someone said that there is a third god, who is overcome with concern. Sensei is in his room. Ami is there, but something is wrong, and she can feel \"so many things\" â€” she repeatedly asks Sensei to help her. (The god with the wires, in addition to deleting \"viruses like depression or bipolarity\", can sometimes make visual alterations, which Nozomu never learned.) Ami says that she's going to die, and says her goodbyes \"for now\". She vanishes. Sensei's door won't open, so he looks around his room. There are several things of potential interest, but he eventually focuses on the cool rectangle machine. He uses information he has been given before to make a connection (or possibly two ).",
