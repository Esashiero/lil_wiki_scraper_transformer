        "synopsis": "Yumi sits in the first floor's hotel room, trying to make sense of everything Sensei told her suddenly . As she dismisses it all as his usual gross attitude, she goes to get dressed, accidentally barging in on Imani as she tries to get dressed. Once she’s dressed, Imani asks Yumi to keep what the saw a secret. Yumi agrees, but is surprised she’s able to keep it hidden. Imani reminds her that she’s only the advisor, and isn’t required to participate as a coach would. The two awkwardly say goodbye. Chika walks in as Yumi continues to mentally chastise Sensei, having been looking for her. She tries to ask Yumi why she decided to leave the beach so quickly, but Yumi continues to dodge around the topic and give vague answers, all while continuing insulting Sensei. Hearing this, Chika tries to pry into Yumi’s true feelings for Sensei, and why she constantly feels the need to insult him at every given opportunity. She suggests the idea that Yumi might be into him, and that, if she is, she’d better just be honest instead of continuing to beat around the topic. The conversation moves on, the two discuss their presents for Secret Santa this year. Yumi reveals she picked Futaba, and Chika offers to help pick out a last-minute gift.",
