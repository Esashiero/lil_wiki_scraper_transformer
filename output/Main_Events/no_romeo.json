        "synopsis": "Sensei blearily opens his eyes as he gets out of bed. He checks his phone to discover he is awake more than two hours earlier than planned, and gets dressed, doubting whether Ami is even awake at the moment. He waits for a few minutes, but becomes very hungry and impatient, getting up and heading to the living room to discover that Ami is indeed still asleep. After a brief internal debate, he goes to wake her up. He is about to leave, after having knocked several times and calling out to her, when he suddenly hears a loud, suspicious noise from the other side. He confirms Ami is indeed awake, and quickly deduces she's up to something. Shortly, Ami comes out, severely flustered and out of breath, which Sensei quickly calls out. Ami remains indignant and tries to deny it, but Sensei phrases his response in a way that makes Ami cave, and after Sensei briefly thinks about the situation, Ami immediately starts trying to shut him up again as they head to the convenience store, only they seem to end up in front of a market stall in the residential district a few blocks away from their apartment, which Sensei quickly calls Ami out on. She explains it would be better to make a quick run for ingredients. Sensei tries to comment on earlier in the morning, but Ami cuts him off, asking the stall owner about rat poison, which they say has been cleaned out due to Ayane's science project . Back at the apartment, the two have a conversation about Sensei's plans for the day, which somehow turns into a discussion about their dynamic compared to the tale of Romeo and Juliet. She starts talking about her childhood before the world 'glitches out' again and the information is lost. Ami cuts her finger and runs into the bathroom to clean it, and the Event ends with a Secret-style end card.",
