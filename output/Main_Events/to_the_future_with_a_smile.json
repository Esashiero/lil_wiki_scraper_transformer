        "synopsis": "Niki, backstage at her Christmas concert, angrily struggles with changing into her second outfit for the night. Otoha walks in, delivering her tea, and is immediately roped into Niki’s backstage tantrum, complaining about the outfit and having to put on a Christmas concert instead of hanging out with Sensei . Otoha sighs and helps her with her costume change. As Niki washes her sweat off, Otoha tells her she’s lucky she showed up, because otherwise, she’d be struggling alone. Niki thanks her for canceling her Christmas date, to which Otoha admits she didn’t have one planned as Rin and her have been fighting. This doesn’t surprise Niki at all, as the two of them are almost always fighting, but she sits Otoha down to give her some advice. Otoha is reluctant to vent to Niki about something so insignificant to her, but Niki reminds her that she respects her enough to want the best for her regardless of what it is. She continues, saying that Otoha’s own inaction and dishonesty make her too similar to Sensei. Even if Otoha doesn't feel the same way as Rin, Niki says she at least deserves the honesty. As Niki tries to push Otoha to go speak to Rin, Otoha misreads the situation and the two awkwardly say goodbye as Niki is called on stage.",
