        "synopsis": "Imani takes over Sensei ’s class and starts her unusual lesson while Sensei, still thinking he should’ve at least convinced her to do things in a slower pace, lets it happen after receiving a coffee from her. Makoto isn’t happy with Imani taking over, even questioning her qualifications to teach them, but Miku tries to reason with her and points out that Sensei doesn’t teach them anymore. Makoto tries to rationalizes it by stating that he trusts her with teaching everyone, which results in Sensei silently mocking her gullibility. Imani tries to calm her down, but Makoto refuses to acknowledge her as their student teacher since she wasn’t informed of her arrival and doesn’t trust someone who didn’t even bother to introduce herself. Imani gives a quick retort to the former but addresses the latter by properly introducing herself. Meanwhile, Sensei talks about Imani with Rin and Sana , even mentioning her first visit in his office . Sana notices how close he and Imani already seem to be, and Sensei claims that, due to her personality, everyone else will quickly bond with her as well. Becoming increasingly frustrated, Makoto asks to see Imani’s qualifications, but she uses her request to segue into a lecture about dual citizenship in Japan. While she continues her lecture, Noriko and Kirin get some ideas when Kirin shows how much she appreciates her already. Class comes to an end, Imani makes a quick exit and the girls, still coming to terms with their new student teacher, make their way to the gym. Maya stays behind to inform Sensei that another Secret Santa exchange is coming up and that they put the slip of paper with the unclaimed name in his desk, feeling the need to inform him so he doesn’t forget like last time . She also informs him that she will be at his house later for a Christmas party with her friends and leaves the moment he tries to promise her a separate gift. Sensei checks out the slip of paper and sees that he got Miku. Since he has no idea what he should get her, he decides to just pick something random right before the party starts. Closing this thought, he realizes someone's standing in front of him:",
