        "synopsis": "As Sensei proceeds home from school, someone calls out for \"Tall Guy\". It turns out to be Rin who sits with Sana. Sensei finds it strange that the streets are completely empty and mentions both of the girls are wearing sleeves despite the summer heat. After they discuss nicknames for a while, Sana reveals to Sensei that she is allowed to touch Rin's skulls. She also reveals her insecurity in making new friends since Ayane was the only one who she felt comfortable with before Rin. Meanwhile, Rin responds by saying everyone would want to be friends with Sana due to her being one of the cutest girls in the world. However, before she could reveal more about herself, she gets embarassed and stops speaking. Sensei figures that she was about to insinuate her sexual preference and Rin gets pouty at him for implying she has to keep secrets from Sana. Sana gets seemingly upset watching their playful banter and wants to know how close Rin really is to Sensei. Sensei however manages to ultimately calm the situation down by calling himself and Rin \"bros\" (or, if she has bestowed that title on him, \"homies\").",
