        "synopsis": "With Maya not being here, Sensei already accepts her being \"dead\" and gives into his pessimism. Ayane tries to cheer him up, thinking that she will be fine once they somehow make the reset happen, but Sensei tells her that everyone who isn’t on the roof will be reverted and if this happens to Maya, the Maya they know will cease to be. Sensei starts to beat himself up over this, feeling like it's his fault for ignoring her warnings in the past and is now paying the price for it. Ayane understands why he feels so down, but reminds him that she is even more lost than him and could use his support right now. Sensei knows she’s right, but he can’t shake off his self-doubts and only wishes for Maya to be with him. Both take a seat in front of a planter. Ayane is still optimistic about Maya showing up, but Sensei doesn’t share her optimism. Seeing how worried he is about her, Ayane realizes how important Maya is to him, and while he tries to convince her that all of them are equally important to him, she still thinks and accepts that there’s something special about Maya he can’t share with her. As she jokes about their usual plays , Sensei wonders if Todd is still around, but apparently he ran away the day before, being so fast even Ayane couldn’t keep up with him. Being in her presence and reassured that he still has some good sides worth preserving, Sensei notices that even with Maya \"gone\", he still has something of value next to him. Ayane asks how they can trigger the reset, but Sensei claims he doesn’t know how to do it without Maya, only for Ayane to realize he just doesn’t want to try it without her. She understands, not wanting to leave her friend behind as well, and suggests they should go back into the city and look for her to make sure she isn’t running around in a daze like he did before . While it takes a good amount of convincing on her part, Sensei agrees, not wanting the Maya he knows to become a memory.",
