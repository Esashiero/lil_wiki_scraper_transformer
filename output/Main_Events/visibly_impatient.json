        "synopsis": "It is Christmas morning and a group consisting of Touka , Kirin , Karin , and Yasu wrap up their Christmas shopping. The narrator notes just how excited all the girls seemingly are for the upcoming Christmas party, but takes the time to point out how Touka is seemingly less jovial. The aforementioned girl, being the only one without a present, is revealed to be slowly cracking underneath the perfect facade she puts up; A Christmas without Sensei seems to have sapped her of the usual motivation she previously found so easily, instead being swarmed with thoughts of concern and half-hearted attempts at imagining a solution. The one to break the narrator's spiel is Karin, who asks the group if Sensei will make an appearance tonight. Touka admits she'd be surprised if he did, but tells her that none in the class are banking on the possibility, with him still seemingly deep in the throes of his 'rough patch'. Asserting that their ideal speculation will do nothing to fix the situation, Touka tries to move the topic along. Kirin interjects, though, suggesting all four of them storm into Sensei's home and overwhelm Ami before she can stop them. Karin tries to placate her sister's fantasies, but Yasu ends up being the one to outright dismiss this idea. Yasu informs the three girls that it is not their place to intervene, for they are unimportant people better suited for unimportant roles. Instead, they should continue along the path they're set on, as deviation could disrupt the uncertain future ahead of them. Kirin and Karin are both confused by this explanation, and Yasu clarifies that acting now might break Sensei, singling out Touka as perhaps the biggest risk to his mental stability; Touka, while usually responsible, currently has her judgment clouded and is at great risk of accidentally worsening the symptoms her presence usually alleviates and subjecting herself to torment she would otherwise avoid. Kirin is still entirely convinced of her plan to overwhelm Ami, but Karin refuses to participate. Touka points out how Kirin is the only one of them visibly upset by Sensei's absence, something Kirin admits, even questioning her own sanity when she recalls how strangely calm Noriko is about the situation. Yasu chimes in to remind her that thoughts not related to God are unnecessary, beginning to spiral into her usual religious fervor, and while the others ignore most of what she says, they agree to heed her warning. The group continues along the path, taking note of a woman nearby who's extremely lost. This woman is revealed to be Sara , complaining to Haruka about how much money she's accidentally blown shopping today. Haruka is entirely indifferent to her plight, remarking that Sara should learn to be more responsible instead of asking for help. This obviously does little to calm Sara down, increasingly stressed out about what to buy Sensei for Christmas. She rejects Haruka's flippant suggestions, wanting to buy something to express her concern for him. Sara was easily able to make it through November without seeing him, but as time has passed with no word, she's become increasingly upset and worried as the parallels between his situation and one from her past increase. While she knows Sensei has Ami to look out for him, she's unsatisfied with this, having wanted to be his support during times like this. Haruka's sympathetic, but reminds her that reckless shopping won't fix the situation. Sara admits most of today's purchases are for her, using shopping as a stress reliever. Her mental stability dwindles, and both women take off for another shop, wondering aloud how Sana 's spending this morning.",
