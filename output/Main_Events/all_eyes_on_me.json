        "synopsis": "There are no words when Sensei steps into the classroom . Instead, he's greeted with total silence and the undivided attention of everyone in class. His mind wanders as he tries to think of what to say, contrasting the motivation he felt at the beginning of the school year with his complete lack of it now â€“ What remains are merely impulsive ghosts of these wants. He manages to speak, attempting to be somewhat coy about the situation but failing to garner any sort of reaction. He decides to stop hesitating and to tell them the truth, explaining that for the past two months, he's been confined to his bed as he mentally recovers from the tragedy of losing something important to him. He explains that Ami has been his nurse for all that time and asks that the class forgive her for how rude she might've acted when keeping everyone away from him. Miku 's the first to speak up, with Kirin and Nodoka joining in, all three intent on learning what this \"important thing\" Sensei lost is. He refuses to answer, stating the class would just think he's insane. The class starts to bicker amongst themselves, prompting Imani to demand they all quiet down and give Sensei their full attention. He thanks her but he has not a lot left to say, concluding his explanation with his return to sentience and how he wanted to announce it personally so no one needs to worry about him anymore. Rin vehemently disagrees with the last statement, and Touka fails to see how showing up to school so shell-shocked could possibly be good, which Sensei relents to, clarifying that he's merely at a loss with what to do now that he's so hopeless. Noriko and Molly both chime in to give their vocal support and he thanks them, apologizing to everyone for wasting their time with, what he feels is, childish whining before announcing that he's going to be taking a break from teaching for a while. He's unsure of when he'll return, asking Imani to continue being his substitute until then, and while he doesn't mind spending time with the girls outside of school, he requests they wait for him to seek them out himself when he wants to hang out. His speech finished, Sensei stares down at the floor, lamenting over his miserable emotional state and praying that this will be the last time he's hurt so thoroughly, fully aware that it won't and, if anything, more pain will come. Ami soon raises her hand, asking if she may have a turn to say something. Ayane , Uta , and Io all try to talk her out of this, but a lapse in Sensei's consciousness leads him to yield the podium to her. After a brief introduction, she warns everyone in attendance to keep themselves out of Sensei's life, as his mental state is completely eroded and she believes they'll only make it worse. Imani immediately tries to shut this topic down, with Sensei similarly trying to end it. Both fail to do anything, with Ami insisting that she tell everyone that they're all no good for Sensei, threatening them with violence should they not listen. At some point during her announcement, Maya slams her fist on the table and, with the excuse that she hit her knee and needs to see the nurse, leaves the room, with Ayane realizing that one of her assumptions about her is correct.",
