        "synopsis": "Sensei is looking for Makoto after class, hoping to talk to her about what's wrong . Ami and Ayane correctly guess that she'll be at the lockers. Makoto is still behaving strangely, talking about an endless cycle of sleeping until tomorrow comes, then sleeping again. She tells him that he isn't the one who \"broke\" her â€” she broke herself, or God god did. Other people start to notice them, and Sensei suggests going to the roof to talk. Makoto no longer likes the roof, saying that the last time she was up there, she was \"touched by the dark\". Sensei says that he doesn't want to see her like this, and Makoto comments that she \"only had to snap for you to finally show me an ounce of compassion\", and that she \"would have jumped earlier\" if she had known. She tells him that she isn't really fine, but it doesn't matter.",
