Makoto and Chika try to intervene, because they agreed to leave Sensei out of this for this reason, but Miku sees no issue as long as she only gives him a quick peck on the cheek since it’s just a game and everyone in the room is aware of that. Changing her dare to a kiss on the cheek and under the pretense of democracy, Nodoka asks Touka for her opinion to decide if Uta can do this, and Touka sides with Nodoka and Miku since she agrees that this is acceptable. With her dare “approved”, Uta gets pressured into making a decision, and while she still hesitates, Miku tries to encourage her, but falls silent when she says that she only has to kiss him instead of doing something else .",
