This contest is an obstacle run, but after Imani explains what obstacles both contestants will face, Touka wants to get out of it, because she feels like this competition won't allow her to show her strengths after all. Imani refuses and gives both girls a few minutes to prepare. In the interim, Futaba and Sana have a conversation, noting how both of them have seemingly become more confident, though they don't say what caused their respective change. The contest begins and contains the following obstacles: Once the fire is extinguished, Miku is declared the winner, and while Touka congratulates her, she retracts it after she makes an insulting comment about her.",
