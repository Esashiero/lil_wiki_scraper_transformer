        "synopsis": "Lately , Sensei 's been having this recurring dream. In it, his bed lies in a vast ocean of nothingness, leaving him alone and with nothing but the occasional, familiar visitor to speak to. Each time he finds himself here, he considers waking up to ruminate over the details. But he's been unable to wake up as of late, something he admits isn't so bad as he's never enjoyed being awake. He loves these dreams, being the only place he can see Maya, even if their time together is interrupted by clones and interspersed with warnings of the one \"outside\" who wears her face . He ignores these warnings each time, wanting to enjoy his time with her before his dreams shift and break up the moment. On cue, the scene changes, with a new version of Maya standing in front of him. She chastizes him over and over, not just for his existence, but for the corrosion it's had on her life, taunting him by asking if all the pain was worth it. He laments how her words are always hurtful and true, but that they lack the bite needed to truly pierce his thick skin. She tells him to wake up before disappearing, being replaced with clones of herself and Sensei. The real Sensei tries to enjoy the memory being relayed, but he finds himself distracted by the appearance of the Angels . The two beings pester him endlessly, making fun of the agency and sentience he is, supposedly, pretending to have. He tries to push the two beings away but they force his mind into a state of self-reflection and remembrance. He recalls having been a liar his whole life, but not always a good one, remembering the first time he spoke back to his mother and was forced to taste soap for the first time. It would not be the last time and just as he continued to taste soap, he continued to lie. He became so adept at it, in fact, he can easily conceal his tracks with only the slightest of efforts. This safety does little to tempt him back to reality, however, and he begins to accept an eternity confined to these dreams. Something approaches. It's an angel, formed of scissor blades and spider legs. The being, calling itself Gossamer , asks Sensei why he is so troubled and how it is they can help him, as they are a being who appears to those who need them. He denies them being capable of helping and questions why such a charitable being has never visited him before. Gossamer corrects him, explaining that they cannot appear if Sensei doesn't wish for them to; Such a time has come at least though and while Gossamer cannot return Maya to him, they offer to bear some of his sorrow so that he may continue to live. They insist that, in exchange for acceptance of their presence, Sensei will be granted a place in \"Heaven's Web\", a realm of no sorrow or escape and where true stasis can be achieved. He remains hesitant but the angel claims that their appearance proofs his will and desire to live on, further explains that he's just too scared to take the necessary step by himself and implores him to let them help him wake up. With the added warning that angelic visits will not end with Gossamer, Sensei complies, asking the angel to open the door back to reality. Stepping through the door, he is met with a warped version of the school dorms and, with no one to distract him, tries to commit suicide. He is only stopped by the silhouettes of the four main girls in his life, all of whom encourage him to keep living and \"playing the game\". Despite all their suggestions though, Sensei wants no part of it, screaming that this \"game\" makes no sense anymore – The silhouettes point out that nothing so far has made any sense. They also pint out that he might even still be inside his \"home\" , only to end exactly there. Before he can get too frustrated with his, he's pulled out of his dream.",
