        "synopsis": "After being lost in his mind, Sensei opens his eyes and sees Io standing in front of him, but he’s still partly experiencing a “blackout” as he can’t see her face clearly. Io heard from Uta he was taking care of a drunk Molly , but when Sensei claims he doesn't know how that went , she brushes it off as an expected outcome of dealing with drunk people and uses the opportunity to spend more time with him instead. She apologizes for making their recent interaction weird , and while Sensei says she doesn’t need to, having accepted that their conversations always become weird, she claims she has to apologizes for everything she does and will continue to do it, because it’s part of who she is. Sensei completely regains consciousnesses when Io notices that he’s looking off and wonders if something happened to him, but he claims that nothing did, and when Io assumes she did something wrong, he states that most things don’t involve her so she should stop overanalyzing everything. She reaffirms her feelings for him and how they won’t change no matter what happened, won’t press him any further, because she doesn’t want to be burdened by it, and suggests to continue being like eggshells in each other’s presence. At first, Sensei thinks she got the saying wrong, but she clarifies they are like eggshells – Hollow, useless husks devoid of their good parts that can still be fixed or made more presentable in the right hands. Sensei disagrees with her comparison, because he can feel there’s still something inside him and he can tell it’s either something unnatural or bad. Io offers to take care of it if he agrees to run away with her so both can find happiness and solace together, but he refuses, with her intending to try again. Both are interrupted by Kirin , who came back from walking Noriko to the bus stop and is still mad at him for making her cry . She quickly moves past it once she notices Io and attempts to bond with her, but, as usual, Io makes it hard because she doesn't want to, but acknowledges that both are at least acquaintances, which Kirin sees as a win. She notices Sensei’s expression and wonders if he’s actually feeling bad after learning about Noriko or if he decided to get drunk like Molly. Being reminded of her, Sensei wants to leave with no clear goal as to where, inviting both girls along. While Kirin protests at first due to the cold, she agrees after Io takes him up on his offer and declares her unneeded. He starts leaving with both girls following him. While on his way, Sensei tries to convince himself that nothing horrible happened tonight and ignores several calls and text messages he receives, except for one – Molly’s plea for him to come back so she can talk with him. He ignores it, guides Kirin and Io back to the dorm and tries to escape back into his own mind.",
