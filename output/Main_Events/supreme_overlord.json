However, Maya is tired, Ami is trying to rescue a bird , and Sensei is unable to help because Molly has a strict no-boys-allowed policy regarding her things — as such, Rin has been doing most of the actual lifting. Sensei, Molly, and Rin talk for a while about Rin's participation in roleplaying games (to be kept secret from Chika at all costs), Sensei's proper title, and the upcoming beach trip. Meanwhile, Ami has been unable to reach the bird — Sensei tells her that it \"lives here now\".",
