Not wanting to walk in the heat, Ami gets a piggyback ride to the convenience store from Sensei. Ami asks Sensei what will happen at the end of the school year, which is not far away. Sensei tries to assure her that he might still be her teacher after that, but doesn't actually have a plan to achieve that.",
