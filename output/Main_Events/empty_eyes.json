        "synopsis": "Maya wakes up in a panic while Sensei is thankful his fears didn’t come true. Her eyes look into his and, once she manages to calm down a little, latches herself onto Sensei and tells him what she endured and how much she wants to stay with him while crying into his shirt. Sensei wonders why he doesn’t embrace her while Ayane tries to understand why she couldn’t see her until now. Once her outburst is over, Maya begs him to forget everything she said, but he knows this isn’t possible. She tries to look past it, realizing that the reset is about to occur. Ayane still tries to figure out why she was unable to see Maya, but Sensei assures her that it doesn’t matter since she’s the reason he looked for her in the first place. He also points out how none of them knows how the end of the world works, which now includes Maya as Ayane is still here even though she doesn’t fulfill the requirements of her theory . Maya doesn’t believe this, because there is no other reason she could still be here, but is more concerned about how he managed to wake her up, since she did it for him a few times and it was never pretty . She’s also a bit worried by Ayane being unable to see her but doesn’t think it’s important, because Ayane will forget everything like last time , something she’s looking forward to so at least one will forget her emotional outburst. Ayane wonders if they should check if Sensei can see someone else, but Maya doesn’t think they should risk missing the reset, but takes the time to thank Ayane for convincing Sensei to look for her. After the girls change into their casual clothes, the three make their way to the rooftop. They notice the massive moon in the sky and, after some lighthearted banter, embrace each other so Maya can initiate the reset. The reset occurs and, to Maya’s surprise, Ayane is still with them, has all her memories and they were transported into Sensei’s office, the latter being unusual but not impossible. Maya decides to tell Ayane everything she knows about the time loop, but they are interrupted by Imani who enters his office and thinks that she’s interrupting a private meeting again . After scolding the girls for being late and not wearing their uniforms, Imani sends them outside so she can talk with Sensei. Since he’s too tired, he just wants her to tell him what he needs to sign, but she informs him that only his presence is needed in the classroom when she announces the club migration. He has no clue what she’s talking about and she tells him how the school passed a new policy where every student needs to sign up for a new club and they can’t do that task in their office, but he has no intention to share his office with her. Imani pouts since she hoped they could share it after Wakana banned her specifically from entering her office with a note, which she sees as offensive. They make their way to the classroom shortly after.",
