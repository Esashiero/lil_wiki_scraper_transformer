The contest begins, and both contestants have taken their place on the stage, waiting for Osako to turn on the music. Ayane goes first and gives a passionate performance boasting about her skills, possessions, relationship with Sensei, and how she's better than Uta because of it. Uta's impressed but easily counters every claim she made, with the most outstanding line being her attack of Ayane's purity. Once itâ€™s over, most girls are impressed by Uta's take, seeing her as the clear victor of the contest. Sensei still has to make a decision, though, and since he was unimpressed by both performances, he decides to name Ayane the winner due to her complimenting him, but she concedes before he can do so, claiming that Uta was objectively better and not picking her would be seen as him being biased, though asks to tell Makoto that Sensei picked Uta by himself so she won't get yelled at. After cleaning up the cafe, Sensei and the girls head to the hotel.",
