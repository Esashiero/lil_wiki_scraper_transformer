        "synopsis": "Imani begins the costume contest, with Uta taking the stage first and trying to stall for time. As she's struggling to keep the spotlight, Miku steps up, though Kirin is worried that the whole tablet she took might’ve been too much. Miku got back into character and is much calmer now, but she’s inebriated due to a possible overdose. She teases Sensei with taking her top off, but Imani manages to talk her out of it. With her performance done, Sensei picks a winner and Imani ends the contest. He then talks with the winner and their best friend while the rival comes to congratulate the winner. While this happens, Sensei is suddenly pulled outside by the mysterious dolphin who’s been following the group around. Once they’re alone, the dolphin reveals itself to be Niki . Sensei instantly realizes she was simply jealous of girls fighting over him, which Niki confirms. Noriko joins the two right as Niki invites Sensei on a date for Christmas, which she objects to, offering a date with her instead. The situation worsens when Chika steps outside, offering Sensei the same invitation. Meanwhile, Nodoka attempts to hit on Rika while she grabs a few drinks, but Rika isn’t interested and easily dodges her advances. Yuki threatens to throw her out if she doesn’t stop harassing her customer, until Nodoka questions how many Yamaguchi’s she needs to ‘fend off’ to find true love. Yuki realizes that she's the girl Yumi recently beat up and wants to know what she did to make her daughter snap. When she threatens Nodoka, Kaori steps in to remind Yuki that she can’t treat customers like that. Nodoka tries to flirt with Rika again, but she causes another emotional breakdown, which makes her give up.",
