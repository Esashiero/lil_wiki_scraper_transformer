        "synopsis": "Sensei sits in the classroom with the girls, reflecting on his purpose in the world and how the classroom is a lot louder than one would expect given the environment, and Ayane calls over to him, asking if he wants a slice of pizza. After an awkward explanation about her butler making it and driving it over for her, Sensei declines the offer and briefly returns to his inner monologue. The classroom door opens, and Chika and Futaba both stop what they're doing and look over. Chika greets the newcomer, who is revealed to be Rin , already a bit anxious at engaging with Chika but otherwise significantly better than the last time Sensei saw her . After a bit of banter, Rin heads over to Sensei's desk, where she apologizes for being late to class - something which, given prior circumstances, Sensei doesn't hesitate to dismiss in the slightest. Afterward, he cordially welcomes Rin back, and she gives him a heartfelt thanks, saying he's a big part of the reason she's back to normal. She quickly heads over to her desk next to Futaba, who quickly turns around to talk to her, a conversation which doesn't last very long when Rin mentions a convention, immediately drawing Sensei's attention back to them. Rin asks Futaba for permission to tell Sensei, and despite not seeing the point, Futaba gives it, and Sensei is disappointed to find out not only is the convention a book convention, but that Rin and Futaba will not be attending in the convention -al sense. Futaba accidentally refers to Rin's incident, which prompts Rin to make an admirable attempt at self-deprecating humor, but has to calm Futaba down when this sets her off. After calming her down and a snide remark from Rin regarding Sensei's concern over her, they discuss Sensei's interest in cosplay, and the three chat for a while longer before Sensei heads back to his desk. The school day ends, and Sensei leaves to go about his evening.",
