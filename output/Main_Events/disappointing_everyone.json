Meanwhile, Sensei asks Ami and Maya who he drew for Secret Santa — both of them say that they don't know, and are unimpressed with his attempts to designate his pocket change as a gift. Looking for a real present, he meets Molly , who has an idea for what to do. She gets him to buy an empty bottle.",
