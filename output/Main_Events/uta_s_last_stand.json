        "synopsis": "Outside of his classroom, Sensei tries in vain to calm down an overexcited Uta and answers her remaining questions, some of which are more serious than others. It ends when Uta tries to flirt with him again, but ends up taking her own mind game too far and starts yelling about how she ruined her live on the first day in her new class. Wakana appears from her classroom and demands from Sensei to shut up his miscreant so that at least one of them can do their job. Sensei manages to calm her down a bit later and both go inside. The class takes notice of the new girl and, after some exchanges between various girls, Uta introduces herself to the class, gives them some basic information about her background and personality, and ends her introduction with her signature move . Her move is met with different reactions form the girls, mostly positive or neutral once, but Uta takes special notice of Yumi 's negative reaction to it and, realizing she's a non-believer and the class bully, demands an arm wrestling match â€“ If Uta wins, Yumi will stop bullying her class members, and if Yumi wins, Uta will never do her move in class again. Yumi immediately accepts and defeats Uta in under a second. Once Uta admits defeat, Sensei takes her to the nurse to get her arm checked.",
