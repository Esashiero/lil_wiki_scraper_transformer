        "synopsis": "Sensei is on his way out of school when he spots Chika , Yumi , and Chinami sitting nearby. Surprised and unaware that Chika has slipped out during his daily nap, he heads over to their bench to see what they're up to. Chinami says she can do whatever since she doesn't have school, and Sensei congratulates her. Chika tells Sensei about having left early to meet up with the others to go somewhere, and Yumi quickly tries to rudely dismiss him, but Chinami stops her in her tracks, and Yumi starts making a visible effort to be less abrasive. Chika starts explaining their unique dynamic to Sensei, and tells him they were getting ready to head to the beach. Sensei questions this, but Chika explains it's about to be dead for the day so this is the only time they can go, given Chinami's condition . Yumi is about to tell Sensei off again when Chinami cuts in, inviting Sensei to come with them, something that even shocks Chika. Chinami says she wants to show Sensei her new bathing suit, and Chika tries to question Chinami, but Sensei agrees, and Chika turns to him, even more shocked. She asks Sensei again to make sure he knows she's not trying to turn him into a chaperone, but having already internalized the idea of scientific research thanks to discovering a new area of Kumon-mi, Sensei tells her there's no problem at all, and the four of them hop on the bus to head to the beach. At the beach, Chika asks Sensei if he's excited to see herself and Yumi in their bathing suits, and Sensei jokes that she's trying to seduce him, before Yumi calls out to Chika, telling her to keep an eye on Sensei while she and Chinami are changing. She flirts with Sensei and laments not being able to see him shirtless since he couldn't bring his own swimwear before heading into the changing room herself, leaving Sensei to patiently wait for the three of them to return. Chika comes out first, and Sensei is momentarily stunned by her sexiness, and she explains she needed a new one so she bought it from her workplace at the mall. She tells him she's going to go tan for a little bit while there's still sunlight. Shortly afterward, Yumi comes out, asking for Chika. Sensei pretends to not know who Chika is for a moment and compliments Yumi, but the interaction infuriates her and she storms off to find Chika herself. Sensei waits a little bit longer, and Chinami eventually comes out, telling Sensei to turn around. She fishes for a compliment on her swimwear, which Sensei gives her, and she rejoices before telling him how she picked it out herself. Eventually, she runs off as well, and with the sun already starting to set, he has to choose which of the three girls he wants to spend time with. Once the beach visit is complete and the sun has gone down, the four of them board the bus back into the city proper, and Sensei heads home to go to bed.",
