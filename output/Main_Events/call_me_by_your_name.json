        "synopsis": "After Ayane finishes another one of her usual open-ended intros, Sensei asks why Uta and her are standing in front of his desk, and Ayane points out that Nodoka is occupying her desk, and both just wanted to stay near him. Some lighthearted banter later, Uta reveals that both are actually planning a class event and want his input on the matter. They don't go into details, but promise that it will be a wholesome \"orgy of fun\" that will occur once the number of girls from both floors are even. Uta believes that this will happen soon due to her cute girl senses, and when Sensei asks how he can get them, she tells him close his eyes and believe. While trying in vain to follow her advice, Tsubasa arrives with Touka , the latter remembering him from their meeting at the dojo . Tsubasa decides to stay until her daughter has settled into her new class, and Sensei can tell that this won't end well. Meanwhile, Otoha recognizes the girl as the \"Princess of Kumon-mi Academy\", and when her friends wonder if she's an actual princess, she clarifies it's just a nickname due to Touka being the heiress of the richest family in Kumon-mi and, as a result, being treated like royalty at their old school. She never expected to see her again until Kumon-mi Academy gets reopened, though expects her to leave in less than a week. Back to Sensei, Touka tries to get her studies started, but he clarifies she won't be doing normal lessons from now on. She demands that he does his job unless he wants her to leave his class, but Sensei tells her she can leave if she wants, and when she asks him who he thinks she is, he answers by calling her a spoiled rich girl. Offended, she tries to get her mother's support, especially when he starts calling her by the wrong name, but Tsubasa, who is currently talking with Chika , informs her that her future lies in Sensei's hands, with her misinterpreting it to mean that she will marry him one day. This catches Ayane's attention, who joins them and tries to mediate the situation, though both sides aren't ready to compromise as long as the other misbehaves. Sensei makes it clear that Touka can either accept that she's a normal girl like everyone else or can go back to her overprivileged life, and, contrary to his belief, she wants the latter and tries to convince her mother to let her transfer back into the manor. However, Tsubasa wants her to take some time getting used to this and Chika encourages her to stay by promising her support. Touka is happy to hear this, but when Sensei adds a sarcastic comment, she demands that he at least addresses her by her real name. He does so, which ends with her blushing and becoming bashful, and Tsubasa is happy to see her decision is already proving to be the right one. With this, Tsubasa takes her leave, accepting that her daughter won't receive special treatment but asking Sensei to let her attend her appointments on time, and Touka asks Ayane for help to settle in. While Sensei isn't sure if Touka will like it here, he knows she has Ayane and Chika to support her, though believes that no one else will until they start to look past her behavior and status.",
