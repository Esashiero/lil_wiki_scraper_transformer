        "synopsis": "Ayane and Noriko go after Molly when she runs out of the D&D session she was running. Molly says that she just wants to cry alone, but Ayane asks her to talk about it. Noriko figures out that Molly is jealous of Otoha because Rin is crushing on her, although Molly doesn't want to admit it to them. When Osako happens to find them, Ayane suggests that Molly could talk to her about it. After Molly has left with Osako, Ayane and Noriko talk about what happened. They also talk about Ayane's relationship with Sensei, and whether Noriko is jealous. Meanwhile, Osako talks to Molly about making her feelings for Rin clear rather than just waiting and hoping, since her current approach obviously isn't working out well for anyone.",
