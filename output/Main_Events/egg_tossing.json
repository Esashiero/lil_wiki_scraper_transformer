They tell Sensei that Makoto has been looking for him. They talk about what to expect at during the trip, and whether it's a good idea to try swimming in the winter. Yumi has had enough of talking to Yasu, and goes for a walk â€” Sensei accompanies her. Eventually, Yumi reluctantly admits that there's something she wants to ask him, but in the course of asking her what it is, Sensei ends up getting \"zoned out\" again. When he recovers, Yumi says that she'll tell him tomorrow. Sensei goes on to talk to Uta and Io . He shows them to the inn.",
