He doesn't actually know, since he hasn't done anything more than talk with Ami about it, but Futaba knows, and Makoto is delegated to organise everything. Afterwards, Rin tells Sensei that she is \"not great\" at sleeping in new places, and asks him to look out for her if anything like last time happens.",
