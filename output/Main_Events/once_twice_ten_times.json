After talking to them for a while, he finds that Maki and Haruka are also present. Sensei notes that they seem comfortable with each other, and learns that they've occasionally kissed when drunk. After letting Kaori go home, Sara joins them. She eventually invites Sensei upstairs, where she either provides him with some medical assistance or just falls asleep.",
