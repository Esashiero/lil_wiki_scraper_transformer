        "synopsis": "Sensei walks down the hallway to his class, noting that the migration process is slowly coming to an end, which means that the hallway would be packed with girls right now, but thanks to another janitor being killed during gym class, most of them already left. While looking for vending machines he might've missed, he gets called out by someone, who turns out to be Futaba . She's with a girl he doesn't recognize, but when she introduces herself as Nodoka and reminds him of their first meeting , he remembers her and her unusual preferences. Futaba asks if he can arrange Nodoka's transfer from Wakana 's class to his, and Sensei figures out that she's the haiku girl she mentioned before , though Nodoka tells him that it was a one-time thing that branded her as a miscreant in Wakana's eyes. Futaba thinks that adding her to his class would improve everyone's opinion of his teaching methods, because Nodoka has the highest standardized test scores in Kumon-mi and having her would make everyone in his class having high scores look more plausible. Nodoka is fine with being transferred, but has some conditions she wants to discuss with him the following day in his office, needing to make sure that her assistant will be available. At that moment, Wakana appears, demands that Sensei takes Nodoka, being completely fed up with her antics, and quickly leaves when Nodoka annoys her again. Once she's gone, Sensei points out how open Nodoka is with her opinions, but she sees no reason to hide them when there's no benefit in doing it. Sensei disagrees, as someone who manipulates others regularly, and claims that being manipulative can be helpful during certain situations. Nodoka starts to like him, yet wonders if he also tried to manipulate her dearest friend or if his rant on manipulation is in itself a manipulation, but Futaba is certain that he wouldn't manipulate anyone in his class. The conversation continues with Nodoka getting hyped by the possibility of embarrassing Futaba in front of an audience, and Sensei is looking forward to have someone in his class who can help Futaba with her personal issues, as well as the other benefits her transfer will bring. Nodoka intends to introduce herself to his class on the coming Thursday, which will be the day when she officially transfers, and asks him to keep it to himself until they completed their mission, which is tied to the conditions she mentioned before. With this, Nodoka and Futaba take their leave, and Sensei goes home, wondering what Nodoka's mission might be.",
