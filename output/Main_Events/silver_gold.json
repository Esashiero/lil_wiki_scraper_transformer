With school now truly in session, she begins to take attendance, with the girls clarifying that, not counting the now-expected absence of Sensei and Ami , only Chika and Rin are missing. Taking note of these answers, Imani tells the class to spend the time until lunch doing whatever, being notably lower-energy than usual. The subsequent chatter from the girls reveals that Sensei's all but vanished following the class' Halloween party , with no one hearing from him at all. Throughout the class, the girls all deal with Sensei's continued absence in their own ways:",
