        "synopsis": "Returning to the girls overlooked by Sensei, Ami and Maya arrive to their school dorms room after their rendezvous at the Kumon-mi shrine. Ami claims that she has to pick up something first, before they head on to Halloween Party. In mix with the comments of mysterious narrator, both friends discuss the dynamics between them, that began to develop after their talk in the shrine . Like with Uta, Ami resorts to her new tactics of getting closer to other girls, but Maya stops her. While Ami attempts to find an item she requires, both girls discuss the details of the agreement, which included Sensei , that they came to earlier. Additionally, Maya speaks up her doubts about Sensei's feelings towards her, but Ami tries her best to cheer her up. With that, further notes from the narrator explain the differences between current Maya and past Maya, and also clear up the idea behind this event's name. Dialogue continues, and Ami begins to raise weird questions that could easily make Maya think: about the boxes she had on her side of room, about the time of their moving to school dorms and all else. Prepared to go outside, Maya expresses her deep love as her thanks. Meanwhile, on the party, Chika has her eyes on Sensei and immediately resorts to thinking out loud about more possible threesomes. As she tries to show and prove her new understanding of love, Sensei worries after each of her sudden comments. Although Sensei tries his best to talk his way out of this, it doesn't help, and Chika points her finger on Uta with Imani: she wants to know whom of the two Sensei loves more. With that, he forbids Chika to bring someone other than members of the class to their twisted relationship. Being unable to unhear Chika's wild screams, Kirin and Yumi , standing nearby, exchange their thoughts about Chika and her mental transformation. They quickly jump onto discussing each other, and Kirin brings up Noriko's feelings about her new friend, Yumi, expressing the desire to befriend Yumi as well.",
