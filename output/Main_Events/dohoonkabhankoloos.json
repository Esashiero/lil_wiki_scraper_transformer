        "synopsis": "Sensei watches his niece sing karaoke while Tsuneyo compliments her singing and Yasu watches in awe. Sensei contemplates if he should check if Yasu is okay, because she hasn't moved since he walked in, but decides that her behavior is part of her religion and looks for someone else to talk to. He approaches Ayane and Karin . Ayane complains to him because he locked his door last night but before she can tell why he might’ve done that , Sensei points at Karin, who gets more and more uncomfortable with the conversation, and she states they were watching movies. Karin contributes to the conversation but gets sad when she mentions her sister . Ayane feels bad and tries to cheer her up by inviting her to their next Christmas pre-party. Sensei thinks it’s a bit early to make such plans, with Ayane quipping how time might suddenly get weird or start over. Sensei wants to know if that phrasing had some deeper meaning and asks her a few more questions, but realizes that she isn’t aware of the time loop. He accepts it and asks Karin about her opinion on time to include her. When Ayane causes Karin to shout out in embarrassment, he decides to check in on smaller girls of their class. He approaches Sana and Miku and asks Miku to not look at Touka . When she wants to know why, he tells her Touka is carrying something she isn’t suppose to see. Miku accepts but wonders what she’s supposed to do when Touka approaches her. Sensei advises her to scare her away by acting poor, but Sana points out how Touka is getting better in that regard. He tells them that they shouldn’t expect anyone to overcome their fears entirely, pointing out Miku’s discomfort with loud noises as an example and immediately wonders if she’s doing okay. She assures him she’s fine since she and Makoto arrived a short while ago. He asks where Makoto is and Sana answers that she’s sitting on the bed with Imani and Nodoka . He wonders why Imani is here, but when Sana recommends to just ask her, he teases her too much and makes her cry. Miku wants to handle her and recommends Sensei to check on Makoto, which he intends to do since she will be the one in trouble for making Sana cry. Miku doesn’t thinks this will happen, but gets confronted by Ayane once she notices Sana crying.",
