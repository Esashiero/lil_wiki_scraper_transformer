As he calls out to her, Ayane speaks up from Ami's room, telling him to join them. As he barges in, he finds the girls in their swimsuits, and realizes that today is the first day of the beach trip. Being shooed away by Ami, Ayane and Sana follow him into the living room, who've changed back into their normal clothes for the trip. They're soon joined by Ami, who demands Sensei apologize to Maya for his peeping. He reluctantly does so, and the group discuss the sleeping accommodations before making their way to the beach.",
