        "synopsis": "A narrator chimes in, reciting a poem seemingly addressed to Sensei . They express their condolences for the drastic shifts in his life, but caution against him becoming complacent unless he wants to pay dearly for it. After a final poem, they encourage Sensei to remain strong, sharing their nervousness about what lies at the \"end of the chapter\". Back on the beach, Nodoka rubs Futaba 's shoulders, flirting with her as she always does. After having her advances repelled, Nodoka laments the gap in \"fun\" she and Sensei are allowed to experience. Futaba fails to see how time with her could be fun, beating herself down for being a disappointment â€“ Nodoka tries to assure her she's not but fails to even slightly change her state of mind, especially once Futaba starts dwelling on the other people in Sensei's life. Off to the side, Rin tries to assist Otoha with the finishing touches for her fake confession. Otoha struggles to find any feelings to put behind her confession, as her feelings for Sensei are mostly annoyance and frustration. Rin suggests to just be honest with him, but Otoha wants to do that on a later date and approach it from a different angle this time, which is hard for her to do since the only time they were kinda close was the accidental tackle in the basement . Otoha asks Rin for some inspiration for the middle part, and Rin offers an extremely well-put-together example off the top of her head. With some prying, Rin confesses it was a speech she thought about giving Sensei in the past, but ultimately chose not because it seemed stupid. Otoha assures her that her feelings aren't stupid and make sense since admiration for people with more life experience is normal for everyone in their class. While Rin's suspicious of this shift in opinion, she drops the topic and the two finish up the confession. Further along the beach, Noriko is confused by Niki 's sudden appearance. Niki ignores her complaints and asks Noriko for help sneaking into the inn, citing a \"business meeting\" with Sensei as the reason. Noriko tries to drive her off, but Niki refuses to relent, especially since she's sure Sensei's eagerly awaiting her arrival. Sensei, meanwhile, is being subjected to the aforementioned wrath of Wakana , who presses her foot into his face as punishment. Imani attempts to talk her down, but fails, especially once Kirin walks in and adds further chaos to the situation.",
