        "synopsis": "Sensei and Ayane make their way back to the girls after their talk with Maya . Ayane immediately starts a conversation about Ami ’ birthday and the Halloween party to figure out to what point in time they’ve been pushed into. Molly , Sana and Ami find her behavior suspicious, especially after her sudden disappearance with Maya and Sensei. When they want to know where Maya went, Sensei drops that she’s probably preparing for their date, which makes Molly wonder if he already finished every other route and erased their collective memory. A frustrated Ami proclaims that there’s only the Ami route, which he’s forced to agree with. Ayane directly asks them for the current date and Ami reveals that they’re all on winter break and that Christmas is the following day. She also complains that they still haven’t worked out the details from the second Dorm Wars , to which Sensei thought that he’ll be rooming with the winning team again , but this was vetoed by Imani , who intended to room with him instead until everyone rejected that and forced her to room with the first floor. After learning that the first floor room will also be the location of the Christmas party, Sensei fully acknowledges that they jumped two months into the future. As Sensei wonders what happened during in the time they skipped, he realizes that he had been speaking to Yumi when it occurred and starts to worry that she might be as confused as they are. He asks the girls if they saw her, only to learn that he apparently spend a lot of time with her between the war and their vacation. When none of them saw after she ran away from him, he makes his exit and tries to find her. Meanwhile, Makoto and Touka sit on the shoreline, watching over Yasu as she prays in the shallow end. As Touka warns Yasu about potentially dying, Makoto asks her to not talk about death so freely around her. Touka quickly apologizes, but Makoto shrugs it off, lamenting that despite having found the courage to come back to school she’s still as sad and sensitive as ever, even though she hoped this new version of her would be different. Touka reassures her that this time won’t last forever, that she isn’t a new version but a sum of her experience, and should she want it, she’ll always lend a shoulder to cry on. After officially forming a friendship, Touka takes the time to ask for advice on her gift to Sensei, worrying that she went overboard again , to which Makoto admits that she’s ‘fucking insane’.",
