When Sensei arrives, he assumes there is no contest and that Chika just wants to spend time with him, but Chinami 's presence proves him wrong. He then learns that him being at her home is part of their contest to see who can throw him the best date, and Chika, since she lacks the money to do anything lavish, decided to use what little she has to show him how much she appreciates him. She calls in Chinami, who does her best to fulfill her role as a waitress and asks them to take place at their table on the balcony while she prepares their dish â€“ Mild instant curry. On the balcony, Sensei notices a table and chairs he hasn't seen before, an Chika informs him that she got them with Yumi before the date started and she wants to use them on further dates so she can repay him for everything he's done for her. As he takes his seat, Sensei struggles to find an answer for her confession and instead gets lost in his thoughts, thinking about his relationship with her, how hollow his feelings for her are and how there might be a world were they aren't. When he finishes, he tells Chika that she'll win the contest, even after Chinami accidentally drops their plates, having enjoyed every moment of their date, even though it was a horrible one.",
