        "synopsis": "Having agreed to hang out sometime, Chika and Rin are talking at the Koi Cafe after school. Sensei , now having finished his duties as a teacher for the day, decides to head to the cafe to get something to drink. He is surprised when he finds the two of them also at the cafe, and Chika waves him over, inviting him to sit down and talk with the girls, who were coincidentally just talking about him. Sensei asks what they're up to, and Chika tells him about how she and Rin committed to hanging out more often, and Sensei inquires as to whether he's interrupting anything, believing he may have just stumbled upon a date in progress, which leaves Chika slightly surprised and Rin flustered. Sensei attempts to check on Rin and make sure she's doing okay, only for her to incessantly stumble over her own thoughts, now very nervous with Chika's presence at the table due to Sensei pointing out the potential for their hangout to be misconstrued as a date. Sensei gives her an out by mentioning food, and Rin bolts off to make some. Chika turns to Sensei, wondering what she did wrong - and knowing it's something with her despite Sensei's insistence otherwise - and after Rin comes back, assuring both Sensei and Chika that she just needed a quick breather, Chika quietly thanks Sensei, promising to make his assistance up to him somehow, and Sensei leaves the cafe to give the girls some alone time and head to bed.",
