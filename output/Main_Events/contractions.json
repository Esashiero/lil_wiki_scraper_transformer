        "synopsis": "Sensei is getting ready to leave school after a rather normal day, his counseling presence needed less with standardized tests coming up. In his inner monologue, he predicts an encounter, and Yumi walks up to him, being rather quiet aside from some snarky comments. She eventually asks him to help her study for said upcoming tests, since she thinks she doesn't stand a chance of passing them on her own. He suggests going to the classroom, but Yumi vehemently denies this, electing to take Sensei up to the roof instead. Yumi storms off, and after a few moments, Sensei follows her up to the roof, and Yumi pulls some books out from where she'd hidden them inside her blazer, and the two sit down. Sensei decides the easiest thing he can teach her is probably English, and he starts doing just that, Yumi occasionally asking questions or offering critiques which Sensei responds to. Eventually, the conversation turns to why Yumi would need English when the borders are closed. Sensei asks her whether she's ever considered leaving and discovering what's outside, in the wider world. She denies this and asks the same of him, to which he replies that he really doesn't know. Sensei reflects on his life thus far and the nature of tragedy, before he tries to help Yumi as best he can with the remaining subjects on the tests, and after a while longer, Sensei - getting yelled at by Ami over the phone for not telling her how late he'd be coming home - heads home to go to bed.",
