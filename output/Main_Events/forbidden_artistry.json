        "synopsis": "Wakana shows up at the beach and rounds up the girls so she can announce the results of her poetry contest. Once again, she takes the opportunity to belittle Sensei for breaking his promise to join, drawing questions from the crowd which Wakana quickly shuts down. Over and over the girls' various questions or comments regarding Sensei interrupt the announcements, causing Wakana to become increasingly aggravated by the chaos. Eventually, though, she's able to announce Yumi as the winner of the contest much to the surprise of everyone, even Yumi herself. When Yumi's called up front to read her poem aloud though, Tsuneyo suddenly lets out a shout, revealing the entire announcement to be part of a set-up by the second floor to win the hug contest. Noriko jumps out from a nearby trash can and begins booking it for Sensei while the girls from the second floor help her to take out the defenders – Yumi gets restrained by Tsuneyo, Maya and Ami are pinned to the floor by Otoha and Nodoka , the latter had to promise to stop pestering Wakana to secure her cooperation, and while Rin appears out of nowhere to act as a last line of defense, she’s swiftly taken out when Noriko exploits her weakness. Sensei accepts the inevitable, and Noriko hugs him, securing two points for the second floor. With the contest concluded, and Yumi's anger subsequently paid off, the poetry contest's real winner is announced to be Ami, and Wakana asks about the inspiration behind the piece. Ami explains she was inspired by old poetry from her mother but refuses to share some of her poems with her. While Futaba sulks about losing, Nodoka suddenly becomes extremely interested in Ami, asking for details about her before wandering off to talk with her.",
