        "synopsis": "Molly joins Sensei and complains about how difficult her life has become. He assures her she’ll overcome this phase and how he’ll try not to abandon her again. She is thankful for his support and happy seeing him wearing her shirt. Molly informs him that Rin left the club, but he isn’t surprised by this since he heard Otoha talk about joining a music club and assumed Rin would follow her. He fails to see how this involves him, until Molly reminds him of his role as club advisor, which he was unaware of until now, and that their club gets disbanded if they don’t find a fifth member. Back in class, Imani gives everyone a last-minute warning on club sign-ups before the bell dismisses everyone for their clubs. Once everyone’s gone, Imani asks Sensei if he knows how to be an advisor since she will be advising the swimming club, but he never did anything for his club and recommends her to ask Wakana when they have their get-together. She decides to leave to make sure she’s there in time and to pick up a custom-made swimsuit for a well-endowed student. He offers to check on her later to make sure she’s okay, but she assures him she’ll be fine since she has no interest in swimming, making him wonder why she chose to advise a swimming club. From here, the event follows the students through their first club day after the restructuring: Meanwhile, Sensei exits the school building and is perfectly fine with not being the center of his student’s affection for once.",
