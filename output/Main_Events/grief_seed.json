        "synopsis": "Miku approaches Sensei to give him some great news – Makoto is finally ready to attend class again. She also wants him to meet her outside so she can instruct the other girls to avoid topics that might upset her. He isn’t sure if he should meet her after his visit , but Makoto expects him and Miku wants him to talk about his worries with her directly. As he makes his way outside, he acknowledges that he has to change the way he treats Makoto since his attempts to give her what he thinks she needs ended in failure. When he talks with her, Makoto makes it clear that she’s still heavily affected. Sensei suggests her to take more time off, but she feels like she needs attend class again to move on and to make the people around her feel better, though she’s knows that she can’t. After Miku goes back into the classroom, Sensei takes a look at Makoto and realizes that while she looks normal on the outside, she completely changed on the inside and he needs to learn more about the reborn Makoto. Sensei decides to relieve her as his assistant, but since she liked working for him, she wants to continue being his assistant, which makes him happy because he was dreading having to work himself. He still wants to prove that he’s serious about making her life easier and Makoto decides to wait and see if he can actually keep his word, though isn’t surprised to hear that he doesn’t want to extend it to their private meetings. He asks her what she intends to do for now and she just wants to get her attendance back on track, to apologize to everyone for her behavior and to stay as unseen as possible. Makoto is still nervous about coming back, but knows that she will never feel out of place here. She sneaks into the room with Sensei, immediately makes her way to her desk and reads the notebook she left behind. While everyone looks at her for a moment, but after Miku glares at them, it’s like nothing ever happened. Meanwhile, Ayane and Uta are making preparations for Operation: Phoenix, which contains the revival of the Dorm War. Imani hears the part about Uta beating Ayane by questioning her virginity , though she’s only interested in the competition. The girls give her a short explanation and Imani wants to compete as well. Ayane informs her that she can’t participate, because she doesn’t live in the dorm, but she could be a judge if Sensei allows it, so she immediately runs towards him and begs for his permission. He’s surprised to hear that there will be another Dorm War but doesn’t want her to be a judge, because having an even number of judges would overcomplicate the decisions. Her attempts to act cute to change his mind and to threaten him with telling everyone what happened between them in the locker room fail as Sensei is unaffected by the former and discourages her to do the latter. He still caves in and allows her to be a judge, but not for the bonus competitions. When she asks him about them, he uses the bell to make a convenient escape. While he hopes that there will be bonus rounds, he’s still worried about being at the mercy of the girls again.",
