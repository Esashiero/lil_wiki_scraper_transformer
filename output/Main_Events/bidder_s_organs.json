Yasu , on the other hand, talks about its content like she understood and sympathizes with it, though notes that some of the details are off. Meanwhile, Sensei drags Nodoka to a remote part of the beach to be alone. Before anything else, though, they share a conversation about his thoughts on her story, Nodoka's sudden interest in Ami , and what their current dynamic is. Once they're done, Sensei asks for her help to get rid of some of his emotions and, after having her promise that it wonâ€™t end up in her books , gives her a piece of his true self while also fulfilling a promise he made himself .",
