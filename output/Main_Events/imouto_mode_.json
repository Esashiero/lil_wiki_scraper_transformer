        "synopsis": "After a peculiar dream about a graveyard, where some tombstones are engulfed by vines or eroded by time, and observing a large yet familiar tombstone, Sensei is woken up by Ami calling to him. She prepared breakfast in bed for him and acts like a little sister. Not knowing what's going on, Ami explains that her contest is a little sister contest, and when a very affectionate line from her gets a comment from the entrance, Sensei notices that Makoto and Uta are observing her performance. While Makoto is appalled by Ami's affectionate lines, Uta suggests Sensei should enjoy it until Noriko 's turn, who's impatiently waiting outside. After eating his breakfast, Sensei lets Ami hold his arm, and she shows her usual affectionate side for him, albeit with a fictional story about them being orphaned siblings to fit the role. Noriko gets fed up waiting outside and demands to witch places with Ami now. Uta agrees and Makoto doesn't mind, especially since Ami has the edge with waking him up, but Noriko predicted this and mixed a light sedative into the coffee. While Sensei falls unconscious, she changes places with Ami. After waking up again, he finds Noriko on top of him, already acting like a little sister. She lets her emotions run wild, but because she goes overboard, Makoto intervenes. With both contestants back inside, Makoto asks Sensei to pick a winner, and he either picks Noriko for being the more authentic little sister despite her using a sedative, or gives Ami the win by basically disqualifying Noriko for drugging him.",
