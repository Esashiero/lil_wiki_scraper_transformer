        "synopsis": "Pareidolia connects to Sensei , pointing out just how things have started to unravel. They calmly explain the reason for this: It is \"their turn\". They expect there to be opposition from \"both sides\", but insist to Sensei that if he follows them, they will guarantee the safety of those he loves. They sympathize with his recent plight, that is, his struggle to choose what is right and what is wrong, but refuse to give him an answer on what to do â€“ Individuality is a gift, they claim, and what is good and bad will all come down to perception. From their point of view, though, they can see the future. And in that future, Sensei is happy and content, safe from the turmoil of his mind. They advise Sensei to keep this talk in mind the next time he makes it to a reset, and warn him not to open his eyes until it's over unless he wishes to move closer to \"the dark\". A narrator speaks up, chipper and ready to begin the, now traditional, beach monologue. They narrate as the view switches between various groups of girls, all experiencing different things: The narrator wraps up their monologue, revealing themselves to be the mysterious, brown-haired girl. While there are still plenty of things they want to ask and learn from the listener, it's all too much to fit into their monologue. They sign off, waiting for the light to shine once more and hopeful of the opportunity to, someday, hold the listener's hand, something they wished they did more in the past.",
