        "synopsis": "Sensei , surprisingly enough, has been dragged by Ayane to karaoke night with Ami and Maya , to Ami's elation and Maya's disgust. Maya doesn't want him there at all, but she is unable due to there being food at the venue and due to Ami and Ayane immediately outvoting her. The three talk about what Sensei will be doing with them, and he says he'll let them  have their fun and hang back, not really interested in karaoke and not liking the sound of his own voice to boot. Sensei is surprised to find out through Maya's own disgust that she's actually a very good singer, and Ayane tries to defend him, only to be effortlessly rebuffed by Maya, who also states she would much rather eat than sing. Before entering the bar, Ami pulls Sensei aside to briefly explain karaoke etiquette to him to make sure he doesn't end up offending anyone. The two go in, where Ayane starts singing Despacito and has the song queued up another four times, and Ami explains that she and Maya just let Ayane get the energy out of her system before proceeding with their own selections. While Ayane continues to sing in the background, Ami and Sensei discuss the venue and Ayane's seemingly boundless energy and Sensei's surprise over Ayane's now-known ability to speak Spanish, something which Ami attributes to Ayane's butler likely having taught her.  Ami, no longer able to stand Ayane and motivated by Maya's desire to eat, grabs Maya and drags her out to grab something to eat, leaving Sensei to suffer Ayane's singing. The four eventually leave to head to bed for the night.",
