He voices this opinion, and Maya quickly tells him she's not here because she wants to be - she's come to warn him of something that he must be ready for, otherwise horrible things will happen. Before telling him what she's come to warn him about, Maya asks Sensei if he has enjoyed his time in Kumon-mi, and he answers that he has - reality glitches if he tries to say anything otherwise. After this exchange, Maya warns him that this unknown event is going to happen in relation to Ami , and that she'll destroy him without hesitation if he hurts Ami in any way. He says that's fine since he has no intention of ever hurting her, and Maya quickly excuses herself, but not before telling Sensei that not all is as it seems. Afterward, Sensei leaves to go about his evening.",
