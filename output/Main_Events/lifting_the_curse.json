She notices the bird which was there when Molly moved in , and suggests giving it a name â€” Noodles . When Sensei tells her that she needs some interests beside noodles, Tsuneyo gives a surprisingly direct response, but she doesn't actually know what it means. When Sensei refers to her words as a \"curse\", she drops her boxes, alarmed at having wished a calamity on him. The sudden crash upsets Miku , who tries to order Sensei to push-ups as punishment. Tsuneyo does them instead, lifting the \"curse\".",
