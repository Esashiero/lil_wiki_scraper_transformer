She is reading The Yellow Wallpaper , and wonders how Sensei would fare if he were stuck in one place like the protagonist of that story. Nodoka wants to see Sensei's room, and they head to the inn. They meet Wakana and Osako , who are less pleased to see Nodoka than she is to see them. In Sensei's room, Sensei and Nodoka meet Kirin , who may or may not be upset at Nodoka's presence.",
