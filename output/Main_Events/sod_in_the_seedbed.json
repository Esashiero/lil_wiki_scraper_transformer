She gets referred to as a cottontail, a girl born when a greater and a lesser power mate, who is closer to god than other people. The narration gets abruptly interrupted and the reader gets prompted to disregard the previous information. The Event gets recalibrated, which causes Tsuneyo and Miku to experience something weird. They canâ€™t remember their previous conversation and talk about something else. If the player chose to trade Nudes, Rin confronts Otoha about the picture. Otoha seems to be genuinely sorry. Otoha also admits that she had a crush on someone else during their relationship but accuses Rin of doing the same thing. After the conversation, Rin is still pissed but all in all, it went over pretty well.",
