        "synopsis": "Having grown , Sensei begins to make his way to school, baffled by his surreal surroundings. As he continues along the path, his legs interject, disagreeing with this decision. The left leg tells him they're going where they want to, for once. He tries to fight them, but the left leg refuses to budge, justifying their defiance by informing him Maya's yet to arrive at school. Helpless to the whims of his feet, he's dragged along to the Old District. Upon arriving, he begins to bicker with his left leg, causing it to detach itself from his body in anger. This doesn't last long, with the left leg reattaching itself soon after, begging to leave after \"seeing something\". Finally at school, he wanders the halls, finding the path to the roof blocked by a stack of boxes he can't move. He leers at them, hoping they'll disappear on their own. As he's staring, the Angels appear in front of him. They tell him to find another way to the roof as they're currently renovating the section past the boxes. He tries to think of another stairwell to the roof but doesn't know of any. All three of them dance at Sensei's ignorance before the Angels direct him to turn right. Turning, he finds himself faced with the stairs to the roof, which he thanks the Angels for helping him find. As he thinks to himself, a talking bug net interrupts his train of thought. Declaring itself to be the “guardian of the school roof”, it tells him to turn around unless he has a good reason. Explaining he's there for the reset, the net ponders why he'd want Maya to initiate it since Kumon-mi is much more peaceful without people. This thought spirals into the net's personal theories on the strange phenomena in town before it bluntly grants Sensei passage, much to his relief.",
