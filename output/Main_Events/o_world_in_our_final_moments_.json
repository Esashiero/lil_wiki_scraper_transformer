        "synopsis": "In the wake of Sensei 's mental breakdown , the omniscient narrator questions the player on their choices and how Sensei came to be in the world, before sending the player back. Ami wakes him up with tears in her eyes, asking if Sensei is ready to go. Sensei automatically affirms this while internally noting he doesn't have any recollection of what's going on, or why it feels like he can't control himself. Getting up, he eventually decides this must be the event he was warned about in advance. After getting dressed and taking a bus ride, Sensei and Ami arrive at the cemetery, and he understands the gravity of the situation, though he wonders how he even knew to come here. Ami asks if Sensei thinks they - her parents, Sekai and Nozomu - would be proud of her. Sensei, again not in control, says they would be, and he isn't sure where he would be without her. Ami reiterates the sentiment and tries to say something, but her emotions get the better of her and she collapses to her knees in front of the headstone. Ami begins trying to ask her parents questions both she and Sensei know they can't answer, becomingly rapidly and increasingly emotional, begging to be heard, and Sensei takes a knee next to her, trying to reaffirm the reality of the situation in the gentlest way he can muster. This doesn't work, and Ami turns to him, begging him to explain to her why her parents can't talk to them. He can't muster a response due to just now realizing that this is something Ami's kept hidden the entire time he's been in this world, but eventually he loses control again and starts telling Ami about how he doesn't need to talk to them here, since he talks to them every night before bed, explaining all the stories of Ami's development since their passing. Ami asks why she suddenly feels oddly happy, and Sensei explains that even on days like today one can still feel joy. He tells her a quote about how there is no happiness without sorrow, and Ami says he sounded really cool for a moment there. Ami manages to smile for the first time the entire day, and Sensei tells her he'll do everything he can to lift her up and protect her, and asks her to promise she won't break down again. They stay at the cemetery for the rest of the day - Ami failing to keep her promise and breaking down thrice more - before going back to the apartment. Ami has Sensei promise her they'll forget about today until this time next year, and he agrees, and once they get back, they both head to bed.",
