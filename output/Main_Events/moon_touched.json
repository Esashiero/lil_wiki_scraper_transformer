        "synopsis": "The group reconvenes in the hotel room, Imani announcing that it’s time for the Secret Santa exchange to begin. The girls all go around, giving out their gifts, with Molly handing Yasu a replica of a magic staff. Nearby, Touka worries about whether or not Sensei will like the gift she got him, as she has a track record of buying over-extravagant things . Meanwhile, Ami , Maya , and Ayane sit in a circle, with Ami waiting for Ayane to give her a gift. Ayane and Maya both reveal they don’t have anything, as the trip sprung up on them unexpectedly , which Ami finds hard to believe since she remembers them all shopping together a few days ago.  At the same time, Chika flags Sensei down, grabbing him so she can give him a personal present. She leads him outside, revealing that her actual present for him will take longer to arrive, but that she has a surprise for him regardless. This surprise ends up being Yumi , and Chika leaves the two to talk alone. Yumi sits him down and tries to continue the conversation they were having at the end of the Dorm Wars. While he watches the moonlight reflecting from the waves, he reflects on his time together with Yumi and what might be one day. She asks him what he thinks of her as a whole, because she thought a lot about him and got more and more confused. She sees him as an irredeemable person who will let everyone around him down with his behavior, but also recognizes that he did more to help her than every other adult in her life, which is why what he said to her recently confuses her so much. Sensei admits that he just wanted to be honest with her, but she didn’t want him to be as his words, his relationship with Chika and his betrayal in the changing room resulted in hurting her. When Sensei asks why she feels hurt, she snaps at him, telling him that he should’ve figured out that losing the only supportive adult after years of doing everything alone would hurt her. Once she calms down, she asks him how it feels to abuse his power to prey on the weak. Sensei takes the opportunity and picks up where he left. He admits that he only started to spend time with her to prey on her weakness, but this changed as time went on and he genuinely wanted to help her, but these feelings couldn’t erase his original one’s as they still exist. He already wanted to tell her this two month ago, but she reminds him that this all happened yesterday . Sensei digs deeper as Yumi realizes that she can’t remember the last two month or has contradictory memories of it, but she doesn’t believe him when he explains it with a time jump. Sensei receives a text from Noriko, reminding him of their plans for tonight. After getting the okay from Yumi, who informs him that their conversation will continue once she can think clearly again, he leaves.",
