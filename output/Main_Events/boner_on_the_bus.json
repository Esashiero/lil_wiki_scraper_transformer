While Sensei usually looks forward to their beach trips, he’s unable to feel excited this time as he’s too worried about the shorter intervals between and the increased frequency of the class's big events. He laments the inevitability of his life becoming more complicated and how it'll no doubt suffocate him further and further. Across the bus are various groups in various conversations:",
