Ami and Ayane lament their failure, seeking out Maya to learn about the maid contest's outcome. At the same time, Makoto verifies Kirin's victory before she starts heading home. Molly calls Tsuneyo over to discuss last night's standup routine. She questions why Tsuneyo would think it was okay to casually mention something so sensitive, especially when she just wants to put it behind her. Tsuneyo responds that, regardless of how Molly saw, it doesn't change the guilt and disgust she feels about not saving her - That she told the joke to feel like it wasn't just some incident only she knows about. Molly understands her protectiveness, but that she had no right to reveal it. The two apologize to each other, and promise to try and be more vocal with each other.",
