As usual, Kaori turns out to be the waitress, and Rin and Futaba are surprised to learn that Sensei went on a \"date\" with her. Kaori mentions that their relationship involves her handling his \"meat\", but the resulting misunderstanding is eventually cleared up. Sensei hits on the idea of asking Kaori to tend the bar at the Halloween drinks Sara mentioned . Kaori agrees, but wants Sensei to go for a walk with her when she gets off work.",
