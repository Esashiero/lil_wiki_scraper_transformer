        "synopsis": "Yumi is exhausted from taking care of Chinami , talks with Chika about her obsession with Sensei and gets grossed out when Chika wouldn’t mind him keeping a picture of herself for personal use. Chika thinks that she should stop being prudish and talking people down, but Yumi points out that she made improvements since she hasn’t talked to Futaba after her apology . Chika sees that as a step back, but Yumi doesn’t want another friend who’s obsessed with their teacher and doesn’t mind being alone. Hearing this makes Chika sad, but Yumi tells her feeling sorry for themselves won't change their situation. Chika agrees, and begins to wonder how Chinami is doing, with Yumi saying she's probably fine. At the same time, Tsukasa tries to boast to Chinami about her status and influence, but Chinami, having no knowledge about the Tsukioka’s or the outside world, isn’t impressed. Tsubasa tries her best to calm her daughter down, but fails due to Tsukasa's warped worldview. Chinami wants to know if becoming a Tsukioka would give her more opportunities in life, like eating things she’s allergic to, but her excitement dies down when she learns that it doesn’t. Tsukasa gets annoyed by her way of speaking and wonders what she learns at school, but Chinami explains that she can’t go to school and instead runs a giraffe empire . Hearing this, Tsukasa gets jealous and asks her mother if their family has entered the giraffe industry. Tsubasa, having stepped away to start drinking wine, informs her daughter that they haven't, becoming angry as Tsukasa continues to energetically deny this as true. Tsukasa is interested in Chinami’s business and promises to crush hers by becoming a competitor, but Chinami is happy to have a rival. She gets hungry and tries to get some peanuts from Tsubasa, but she’s aware of her allergy and denies her request. Tsukasa, seeing an opportunity to start a business relationship, offers her a feast and asks her mother to order something. Back at the party, Chika thinks that Yumi is right about Chinami but still intends to to check on her, partly to get away from all the girls throwing themselves at Sensei.",
