She says that it will be the first time a single \"iteration\" of Sensei has lasted long enough to see a third reset, and that if he wants to avoid non-existence, he should focus on staying who and where he is. Her suggestion of killing Noriko doesn't appeal to him, so she suggests that he \"just do things normally again\". She tells him that she will be waiting for him on the roof, just like always.",
