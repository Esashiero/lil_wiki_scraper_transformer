        "synopsis": "Sensei finds himself at another part of the beach to keep his promise to meet someone. His mind goes through another mental breakdown until Yumi calls out to him and breaks him out of it. She assumes that he should get his mental problems checked out, but he thinks he will be fine and wants to get this conversation out of the way so he can attend the sleepover. She reminds him that this already happened , which causes another breakdown. Seeing his condition, Yumi has second thoughts about their meeting, but Sensei assures her that he’s fine and that she can slap him if he zones out again. Both take a seat on a nearby rock as Yumi struggles to tell him what she wants and Sensei gets lost in thoughts. She starts the conversation by talking about her job hunt efforts, which ends up with Sensei telling her that her mother managed to get hired at Sara’s bar when Yumi makes a snarky comment about her. She’s surprised to hear it, but doesn’t care that much since it doesn’t change anything between them. She’s also not happy to hear that Sensei is getting close with her family, but he promises that he isn’t close with them and only hangs out with Yuki sometimes. Yumi finally manages to tell him what’s troubling her – Her seeing him with a woman the other night . She explains that him wandering around wasn’t that weird, but it got weird when the woman talked about clouds, which felt familiar to her, and when he called her Kaori , who, after affirming her appearance, is most likely her cousin. Sensei wonders why she never saw Kaori, considering her working at multiple restaurants and having posted photos of herself for a while, but Yumi didn’t have the opportunity to see her. Sensei still fails to see why her being here is weird, until Yumi says that, to her knowledge, Kaori already passed away. Yumi explains that Kaori was her closest friend during her childhood, until she was caught in an accident and hospitalized. After a while, she received no new information about her condition and assumed that Kaori succumbed to her injuries. Sensei remembers her mentioning that she was hospitalized, but until he heard Yumi’s story, he assumed Kaori wasn’t human since she acts like she needs to relearn everything about life itself. While she isn’t the girl Yumi knew, he still thinks that getting close to her would be helpful, especially due to her work ethic, but Yumi feels like she shouldn’t bother her if his description about her is accurate. She’s just happy to know she’s still alive and open to meet her again one day. With her doubts being cleared, Yumi decides to leave. Sensei tries to keep the conversation going, but she suddenly disappears, leaving him alone on the rock.",
