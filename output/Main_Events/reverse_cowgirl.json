Tsuneyo is mad at him for prompting her embarrassing question at breakfast, and in the ensuing discussion, Miku turns out not to know certain terms as well. Chika firmly changes the subject by asking Sensei what he did last evening, which leads to conversation about how Tsuneyo got to bed after getting drunk and why Sensei met Sana in the middle of the night. Chika says that she's going to meet Rin later, and shares her suspicion that Rin has a crush on Sensei â€” this does not strike Sensei as a good sign, since Chika has clearly not picked up on Rin's hints.",
