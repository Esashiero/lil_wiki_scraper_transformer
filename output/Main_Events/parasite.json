        "synopsis": "Sensei sits in his office, waiting for someone to show up. He has a brief monologue before being interrupted by someone knocking and calling out from the door. After a moment, he tells them to come in, and is surprised to find Kirin , one of the two girls from the soccer incident , standing in front of him. Not having really talked before, he gets her name wrong, but after being corrected, promises it won't happen again. When asked why she came to Sensei's office, Kirin says she wants to do something fun, and points out the sounds she's heard as she's passed by the office in the past. When Sensei asks not to expose that, Kirin says her lips are sealed so long as she does him a favor, that being to vouch for her future absences. She also promises to do him a favor in return if he handles the situation properly. In addition, she lets him look down her skirt, and Sensei internally wonders how she could be even more forward than Ayane . Kirin becomes annoyed when Sensei asks just who she is, and exasperated when he mentions rather than aroused like she expected him to be, he's actually somewhat intimidated. He eventually agrees to help her out, and the topic turns to where Kirin would like her first time to be. Sensei becomes briefly alarmed when she flippantly mentions Ayane's first time , but calms down when Kirin explains that she has a natural intuition for guessing things like that. She leaves to meet her sister , and Sensei wonders what just happened, before leaving to go about his evening.",
