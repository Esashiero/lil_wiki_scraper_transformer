        "synopsis": "It's another normal day of school for Sensei , with the sole exception of Wakana occupying the couch in his office, though this happens more frequent as of late. He asks her why she's in his office during his counseling session, but she avoids the question at first and wants him to massage her feet, which he refuses. After getting more comfortable, she vents about the next wave of students being migrated into her class, though Sensei has never heard of another wave. Wakana reveals that he won't get any more students through the migration process, while she gets even more, which includes two miscreants in the form of an anarchist and a haiku girl. He feels like those should've been added to his class, and Wakana offers to trade them for Makoto , which he doesn't mind as long as she gets her approval, fully convinced that, outside of the resets, she will never disappear from his life. He asks why she even bothers coming to him when she does nothing but complain, and she tells him that every other teacher is either too old or annoying, and his office is the only place she can relax a bit. Suddenly, Ayane announces her presence outside and mentions something inappropriate, only then noticing that Wakana is with him. Once she enters without permission, she apologizes and lets him choose any punishment for her misbehavior. Sensei states that she shouldn't say suspicious stuff around Wakana, but Ayane knows that she won't bother with anything that's outside her paygrade, and also reveals Wakana's relationship with her karate teacher . Sensei tries to get more information out of Wakana, but once she figures out why he's so interested, it causes another rant from her in which she accuses Sensei of trying to get too close to her when she asked him to massage her feet, with Ayane being both intimidated and infuriated by how close Sensei and Wakana already seem to be. Wakana asks Ayane to massage her shoulders, not wanting someone she barely knows to touch her feet, which confuses Sensei on how close he actually is with her. While Ayane massages Wakana's shoulders, she asks if she knows anything about Osako's dojo being purchased by the Tsukioka family , and apparently the deal is almost done, though she has no clue if her girlfriend will keep her job, which saddens Ayane. After some more venting from Wakana about the migration process and Sensei's incompetence, Ayane wonders if they will get further additions to their class, and Wakana promises they will, if not through the migration process itself then through her pawning off miscreants to his class. Ayane focuses on her massage to help Wakana relax, which ends up working since she takes a nap by the time Sensei and Ayane decide to leave.",
