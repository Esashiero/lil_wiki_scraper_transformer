        "synopsis": "Uta and Makoto gather up the class to announce the results of the Dorm War . Although most of the contests were decided without Sensei 's input, the choices he made are sufficient to tip the balance. Sensei arrives after the results were announced and thinks back on it, being satisfied with the prospect of cute girls fighting over him but dissatisfied with his lack of freedom. He decides to join Io , who's sitting alone at the fountain. She announces to him that Yumi won their contest, although she isn't surprised by this. He tells her that she could've come to the bar last night , as it was an \"interesting\" time and might've had fun just shadowing him the entire time. She negates that as a possibility, stating that being around girls in a social setting would be even more tiresome than usual and passive-aggressively jabbing at him due to what she knows now . Uta soon joins them, mad at Io for ignoring her throughout the entire event. Io doesn't feel remorse for not wanting to partake in the festivities, but Uta is upset that she doesn't want to have fun with the rest of the class. With the war officially over, both girls invite Sensei out to have breakfast with them, and after sneaking away from the group and finding a diner on the way, Sensei enjoys his time with the girls, fascinated by the bond both girls share. He heads home once they'",
