While that happens, six of the girls are talking while having breakfast. They talk about their sleeping arrangements, and about the relationship between Karin and Kirin . Tsuneyo surprises them all by mentioning masturbation, saying that Sensei advised her to ask them about it. Ayane promises to explain some things to her, while Karin nearly dies of embarrassment.",
