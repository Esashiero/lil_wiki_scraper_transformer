        "synopsis": "Sensei finds himself aimlessly wandering the streets after school, after being denied the ability to go to karaoke with the girls, and in the middle on one of his inner monologues, he is interrupted by Sara calling out to him. Surprised, he walks over to the small bistro near the school, where he finds Sara hanging out with Haruka , and he is further surprised to find out the two of them know each other from high school, and Sara gives him the rundown of how they lived their daily lives back in those days. Haruka suddenly locks on to Sara calling Sensei as such, and questions the ambiguity of this action, and Sara reassures her it's okay. Nonplussed, she looks over to Sensei, unable to say it, and Sara lets out some very revealing information that Haruka immediately turns on her for. Shortly after, Kaori , who is revealed to be a waitress at the bistro, arrives to check on Sara and Haruka and to take Sensei's order, and once he asks for a burger, the three of them talk about Kaori's eccentric personality and style choice. The topic briefly deflects to Kaori's choice of location for her spider tattoo, and the three of them talk idly about other things until Sara shoos him away. Once Sensei gets his burger, he promptly has it boxed to-go and heads home to go to bed.",
