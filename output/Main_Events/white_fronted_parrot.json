        "synopsis": "Stepping up to Nodoka , Sensei asks her to relay all she knows about the white-fronted parrot. She obliges and asks why such a random animal suddenly interests him. He tells her that if she continues living the way she does, she'll become something horrible in every sense of the word. Nodoka sees no problem with this, asking what this means for them. He confesses that, at the very least, she'll become a venting point for the feeling he can't discard otherwise – His fear. Meanwhile, Otoha and Rin , both still nervous about sharing a room, are slowly drawn closer together and take the next step in their relationship. In the morning, the group meets up in the lounge, though Otoha leaves shortly after cursing Nodoka for her actions, and Rin follows after confirming that neither of them heard anything unusual last night. Sensei struggles to remember any of the previous night, so Nodoka gives him a quick refresher and lets him know that she could confirm something about his background, but needs further research before she can tell him. Sensei wants to know what she figured out, but Nodoka refuses to say anything until it’s confirmed, reassures him that it only strengthens her interest in him and that she can’t wait to see what he discards with her next time. With this uncertainty, he and the girls board the train back home.",
