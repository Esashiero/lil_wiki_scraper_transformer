He searches the living room, Ami's room, and the bathroom before deciding to head to bed. While he sleeps, there is an opportunity to tell another story. In addition to the God of Light and God of Wires , there is a third god, one without either light or wires. However, nothing can be said about this one. Instead, the narrator muses over how different other perspectives can be to their own; The flow of time, events, and even other people's personalities can all appear different depending on who you ask, so itâ€™s good to keep an open mind. Sensei then wakes up, ready to survive and grow.",
