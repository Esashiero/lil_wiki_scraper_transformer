        "synopsis": "Sensei patiently waits at the dining room table with Sana and Maya while Ami and Ayane are busy cooking up a frenzy - it's finally time for their cook-off . Maya complains about going to the movies with Ami, and this not being in her schedule, and Ami reassures her before returning to the competition. Ayane and Ami quickly turn to bickering amongst each other, to the others' slight bemusement. Sensei, Maya, and Sana have a short conversation about Sana's continued efforts to grow more comfortable around others, and Maya questions Sensei's wisdom on the topic - when Sana wonders why their dynamic seems to have shifted, Ami calls out from the kitchen to reassure her this is normal. Ayane brings a sampler of rice over, Maya critiquing her monologue, before serving her rice. After Ami in turn serves hers, Sana and Maya outvote Sensei, giving Ayane a 1-0 lead over Ami. Ayane unknowingly makes a mistake in the next round, however, when she serves spaghetti, which Sana has developed PTSD over , and when Ayane and Maya both ask why Sana has started crying, Sensei resolves to tell them what happened, only for Ami to cut in and drop off her second dish - a plate of omurice which she has spent the past two months practicing. Maya surprises Sensei when she votes for Ami's omurice along with himself and Sana, matching Ami and Ayane 1-1. Ayane tries to regain her lead and win the competition in the dessert round, but her emergency pick of an excessively large banana is beaten laughably easily by Ami's custom choices for everyone's dessert, including a watermelon that makes Maya freeze up in overjoyed shock, giving Ami the win in the end. Afterward, Ami cleans up the kitchen and leaves with the other girls, while Sensei gets up to go about his day.",
