Sensei says that Maya reset the world for him, which Ami doesn't understand. Ami says that not even her best friend is going to steal her uncle away, but Maya assures her that she has nothing to fear in that respect. They realise that they are late for school. Before going into class, Sensei asks Maya if they are just going to ignore the reset, and Maya says \"yes\".",
