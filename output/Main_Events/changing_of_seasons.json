        "synopsis": "Sensei is walking through the city at night, vaguely remembering that there is something he is meant to be doing. He tells Ami to return, and she does. When Ami mentions Maya , Sensei remembers his meeting and goes to school, although he takes a while to find her. She is going to reset the world again, which can be done by praying — Sensei decides to leave it to her. Before she proceeds, she lets him ask a few more questions — he asks about the \"god made of wires\" from his dream, about whether anyone else knows about resetting the world, and about whether she is okay. She points out that resets can sometimes go wrong, but says that she expects this one to go smoothly — hence being dressed for winter already. Maya then resets the world.",
