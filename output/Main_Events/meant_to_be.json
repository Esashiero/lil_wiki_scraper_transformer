        "synopsis": "Sensei snaps out of his \"blackout\", finding a tearful Ayane clutching his hand. She first confirms that it's really him who's with her, before the two exchange their last memories before waking up in the middle of the apocalypse. Ayane relays to him a bunch of important information, the most pressing to Sensei being that Maya has yet to show up after almost five weeks. Upon hearing this, he insists they begin looking for her immediately but is held back when Ayane informs him that the rest of Kumon-mi is inaccessible. He claims that makes no sense, but Ayane points out how this reset is different from what they're used to, proven by the fact that Maya didn't notice it coming while both of them might've . After confirming that neither Makoto nor Sana have shown up either, Sensei is led by hand up the steps to the roof, the whole time trying to convince himself that Maya is fine and will show up soon. He tries to convince Ayane of this as well, but she remains pessimistic about the possibility, something she credits to her month-long isolation. As the two of them step onto the roof, Sensei realizes just why the rest of town is inaccessible â€“ A giant cylinder, consisting of seemingly meaningless images surrounds the school, keeping any from leaving. Ayane tries to explain the phenomena but notes that the images shown change every couple of hours with no noticeable pattern. He continues to insist Maya will show but in the meantime is directed over towards a makeshift camp consisting of a coffee maker, several generators, a television, and a tent, all of which have been set up by Ayane. Sensei's impressed by this survivalist instinct and, after some banter between the two about how many times she's been forced to watch the same movie, Ayane tells him to take a seat in her tent while she prepares him some coffee. Both of them get settled on her futon but while Ayane focuses all her attention on him, Sensei can't help but think about Maya. What makes this worse for him is the obvious signs that Ayane knows this too, and is accommodating him in every way she can. Now that she has Sensei to comfort her, Ayane slips back into her usual self, something that bothers him as he feels there are tons of other things they need to discuss first. However, this is the last thing Ayane wants to think about after a month spent obsessing over the apocalypse herself, asking him to enjoy their time together while they can . Hearing this, Sensei's reminded of the constant warnings this summer and pries deeper into the \" weird feeling \" she's had all Halloween. She quickly deduces he's referring to mysterious voices and, after some hesitation, he reveals to her his fear that tonight will be his last reset. While at first shocked to hear this, she points out to him how ridiculous it is to trust some obviously fake voice. When this fails to convince him, she reveals that she, along with Ami , have been hearing voices but that none of their predictions have come true yet so there's no reason for him to worry. Instead of worrying so much about these encroaching anxieties for what the future brings, she tells him to enjoy today, and worry about tomorrow when it comes. Comforted by these words, the two drift off to sleep, but not before expressing how happy they are to be together right now.",
