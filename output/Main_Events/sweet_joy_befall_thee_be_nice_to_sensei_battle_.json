        "synopsis": "Before the next competition, Sensei was worried about Maya 's involvement and his own, unpredictable reaction. Otoha and Maya had to spend around five minutes with Sensei and find out who could be nicer to him. Meanwhile, Uta and Io discussed what happened recently , and Ami expressed her gratitude and respect to Touka . Otoha was the first to begin the contest, and the two had a genuine, casual and friendly talk in their ordinary manner. After her time was up, she went to check out the Death Ball documentary with Molly and Tsuneyo . On Maya's turn, Sensei resisted her attempts to be cute and shared his view on \"true\" Maya. But it didn't make it easier for Maya at all, so she demanded a little bit of comfort from Akira. All this time, Ayane was observing the two. She couldn't hold herself any longer and spat it out to Otoha, who happened to be nearby. Ayane was out of patience, and expressed her growing discontent. Otoha suggested to discuss the issue, but Ayane kindly declined. This is the first contest where Sensei was making a decision. And the decision was, undoubtedly, crucial.",
