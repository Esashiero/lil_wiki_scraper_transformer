Chika has persuaded Yumi to come to the party, albeit without a costume. Rin asks if Chika knows the reasons for Yumi behavior towards Futaba , but she doesn't. Yumi arrives, and the three have an awkward conversation. Rin starts to tease Yumi a bit about having a \"cute side\", and Yumi goes off to look for food.",
