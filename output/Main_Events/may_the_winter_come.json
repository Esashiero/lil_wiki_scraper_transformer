        "synopsis": "Uta and Makoto get ready to announce the contest for the upcoming 3rd round of the Dorm Wars. Sensei , meanwhile, finds himself uncomfortable with the increasingly shorter gaps in time between the class’ major events, a fact which stands out more since this round of the Dorm Wars will take place during their beach trip. He broods over the increasing tension between Ami and her friends, the possibility of another time jump , and the foreboding feeling that this war will only further fuel the chaos in his life. The girls first decide that, instead of giving a prize for winning last year's Dorm Wars , the winning floor will receive two bonus points to help them win this year's prize: A sleepover at Sensei's house. Ami tries to prevent this, but with no better argument outside of her being bitter about not being consulted, she’s forced to accept it. After Makoto and Uta inform everyone that the date war was axed to prevent unnecessary conflicts, the contests are announced. Sensei heads home, unable to even fake excitement as he’s too concerned about what tragedy this year's Dorm Wars will bring.",
