Maya arrives and tells him that the world is going to end soon — she will be waiting in the same place as last time, and doesn't want him to take too long. Since his mental state might impact that, she asks if there's anything worrying him. He asks what will happen to Molly and Tsuneyo , since they arrived mid-cycle. She doesn't know — some cycles do see them transfer into class, but it is rare. Also, too many students in class is problematic for Maya in ways that she won't explain. Miku interrupts them, but before Maya goes, she warns Sensei that the \"second time can be rough\". Miku is worried about Makoto 's recent behavior , and hopes that Sensei can do something.",
