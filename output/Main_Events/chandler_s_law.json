Nodoka fails to see why Rin even bothers to keep trying after the two have spent the last couple of months fighting. She insists that they should go and enjoy their vacation and that Otoha must not care all too much about Rin if the two have yet to push their relationship further after a whole year. Rin and Futaba both snap back at her for being so insensitive, but Nodoka presses the topic, suggesting that perhaps Otoha is finding solace in someone behind Rin’s back and that she should do the same. Futaba asks why she’s being so blunt, and Nodoka admits she’s gotten tired of the back-and-forth between the couple, insisting that if they won’t move forward, she’ll try and push them forward herself. Rin continues to get angry at Nodoka’s suggestion of cheating, but Nodoka insists that not doing so will only continue to make Rin miserable. The two continue to argue until Futaba puts her foot down, shouting over the two and demanding they stop talking about this. She pushes Nodoka out of the room and tells Rin to put her phone away.",
