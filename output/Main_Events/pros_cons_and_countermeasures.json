        "synopsis": "The slumber party begins, and Ayane tries to explain to their guests, Sana , Yumi , and Noriko , what their plans are, but they delay the explanation with smalltalk and, in Yumi's case, complaints. Makoto wonders where Nodoka is, but Ayane was told by Futaba that she wasn't feeling well, and Sensei adds that he spent some time with her and could already confirm her awareness. The other girls want to know why they're here, but Ayane, since she can't tell them due to the world interfering, states she needs to figure out with Sensei and Makoto how to explain it. After Ayane joins Sensei and Makoto, the girls want to know from Sensei how much Nodoka knows, and he reveals that she figured out they're in a time loop , which completely surprises Ayane but Makoto expected her to figure it out due to her inhuman intelligence. He also adds that while she has figured out more than they have, she can't finalize her theories, because trying to go too deep ends with her in immense pain, which prevents her from finishing her thought processes. Hearing this, the girls assume her pain is either a result of her knowing something she isn't supposed to know or intentionally caused by something or someone to stop her from finding the whole truth. Since theorizing gets them nowhere, Ayane thinks they should return to their current task and try to see if the other girls in the room show signs of awareness, and Ayane has two approaches â€“ Either giving small hints and let them figure it out through them, or directly explaining the time loop to them, though Ayane isn't sure if the second one will be easy this time, since the girls during the first slumber party were already aware of the time loop. She still feels it's worth a shot since it could provide them new information about their situation, though if it goes wrong, the world might reset again. Makoto wants to hear Sensei's opinion on this, and he suggests starting vague to test the water and then attempt a full explanation once the girls show signs of awareness, which he thinks should be fine since neither of them felt a reset coming up. They decide to split up and deal with the girls one-on-one, and Sensei gets Yumi, because he already had a talk like this with her , Ayane takes Sana, since both are close friends, and Makoto is paired up with Noriko, who can easily socialize with everyone. While the girls want to prepare how to approach their targets, Sensei is asked to entertain the other girls in the meantime, though neither of them noticed that Sana was able to hear everything they discussed. Sensei approaches the girls, and Yumi immediately leaves under the guise of needing to use the bathroom. He takes a seat with Sana and Noriko, and while he tries to have a talk with them, Noriko's excitement and usual behavior don't make it easy. He asks Sana for support, but she makes it worse with her wanting to spend some time with Sensei alone, revealing that she heard what he and the girls were discussing and wanting to hear more about it from someone more experienced like him. Sensei declines her request and states only he can get through to Yumi and that Ayane can explain it better, but when Noriko wants to know what's going on, he tries to explain the time loop, but Noriko interrupts and changes the subject, with Sensei explaining to Sana that most of the girls act like that when the subject is brought up. With this, he decides to leave and look for Yumi, leaving Sana and Noriko with Ayane and Makoto. Before he can go, Noriko hugs him out of fear that something is wrong with him, and he assures her everything is fine. Before he leaves, he notices genuine fear in her eyes, which gives him the feeling that she might feel that something is off and might be completely aware of it soon, and also looks into Sana's eyes, who reflect a weird hunger he can't explain.",
