        "synopsis": "Ami brings Sensei back home, whose mind is continuing to unravel, struggling to even properly process the words being said to him. Ami holds him by the arm, guiding him to his room and affirming to him that once he's in bed, everything will be okay. She also assures him that no one will be able to hurt him any longer, insisting the girl's actions have all been an attempt to confuse both of them into believing their relationship is merely circumstantial rather than a truer form of love. Ami insists that, under God, all things happen for a reason and therefore tonight's unexplained tragedy must be part of His plan. Thankfully, Halloween is over and soon everything will return to normal for them. Sensei struggles to process this portion, however, with something unseen interrupting to cast doubt on all he's experienced since waking up. They mock him for his breakdown and attempt to goad him into reverting to the person he used to be. He manages to snap to reality just in time to hear Ami promise to never leave his side, even if everything were to disappear. She reminds him that only she can do that, and anyone who says otherwise is lying. Now sat down, Sensei's internal monologue has halted entirely. In place of his narrating, an \"AUTO-PILOT\" procedure is initiated to substitute. Under its influence, Sensei demands Ami fetch his \"sanity-pack\". She obliges, returning with various items to help him maintain sanity in his indefinite lockdown. AUTO-PILOT fails to spur him into action following this, leaving Ami to fill in the gaps of his silence herself. She talks to herself about all the work that'll need to be done to secure the house â€“ Such as securing his window with bars, installing additional locks on his door, inspecting the attic and his secret hiding place, even contemplating setting up security cameras. After confiscating his phone, and enthusiastically responding to something she believes he'd say, she gets to work. Meanwhile, back in the karaoke bar , Ayane and Makoto attempt to talk to the new version of Maya they've been left with. Confused by the others' strange apprehension of her, Maya outright asks them why they're acting so weird. Ayane decides to be the one to take the dive, bluntly asking if she has any memories of their multiple trips to the apocalypse or their time-traveling club . Maya reacts to all of these questions with confusion and annoyance, believing this to all be some elaborate joke. Ayane insists how serious this all is, and explains to her how Sensei's sudden catatonic state is due to having just lost the version of her he'd spent several \"years\" with. While she doesn't believe this, Maya decides to humor the idea and quips about how miserable that situation sounds; If anything, Ayane and Sensei should be celebrating now that she's apparently been freed from such a tragic fate. Regardless of this, Ayane asks her if she'll at least talk to Sensei soon in hopes that it'll help cheer him up. She begrudgingly agrees, and Ayane suggests to wait until they have the opportunity to see him again, though Maya assumes it will be the following day.",
