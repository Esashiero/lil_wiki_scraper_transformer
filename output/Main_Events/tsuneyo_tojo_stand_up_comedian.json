After winning an optional staring contest, she remembers Sensei from when he visited her family's ramen shop with Yumi , and introduces herself as Tsuneyo Tojo . She tries to tell a small joke, but admits that comedy is not her strong suit. Sensei notes that her demeanor is very formal, and she is startled every time he uses her given name. She was homeschooled until recently, which has left her quite sheltered.",
