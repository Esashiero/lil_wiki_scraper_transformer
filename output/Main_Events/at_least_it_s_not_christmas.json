Ayane and Ami compliment each other's costumes, but agree that Maya 's is the best â€” she has come as Sensei. Rin and Futaba both have costumes reflecting their interests, and Futaba says that she'd have liked to see Sensei in a costume too. Makoto is still lecturing Miku about what happened that morning . Chika is busy on her phone, trying to convince Yumi to make an appearance. Sana is talking to Maya, but leaves after learning more about the costume she's in. Maya is annoyed that Sensei is not more annoyed at her costume choice.",
