She is skeptical about his claim to be attending a party with people his own age for once. She says that she isn't going to the party at Ayane's place the following night, because things like that \"aren't meant for\" people like her, and nobody but Chika would want her there anyway. Somewhat hesitantly, Yumi asks Sensei a \"weird\" question â€” has he has lost some of his memories? Multiple errors are detected, and since the permissions necessary to perform a reset are lacking, a reroute to the next available path occurs.",
