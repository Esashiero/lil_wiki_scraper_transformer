        "synopsis": "Arriving at Sara’s Bar, Futaba approaches Rin and asks how her contest went. Rin asks if their friendship is suffering as well, which gives Futaba a clear answer on how it went and why Otoha is missing. She listens closely to her turmoil and tries to give some advice, but Rin doesn’t think she could do anything without upsetting either Otoha or Sensei . She decides to drown her sorrow in sugary drinks while Futaba joins her for emotional support and to monitor her intake. At the same time, Sana asks her mother if she needs help, but Sara tells her to enjoy the evening instead. Sensei catches up with Ami and Noriko while Imani decides to join her girls. Noriko wants to accompany her, but Imani doesn’t want Kirin to follow her. Ami, still bitter about her loss, suggests to kill Kirin, which both Imani and Noriko are fine with. Rin walks over to Rika and Chika , who’ve been hanging out while waiting for her arrival. She explains Otoha's sudden absence , which reminds Rika about the extent of Rin's past crush on Chika. Rika's lack of restraint in embarrassing Rin, as well as Chika's casual intimacy, causes Rin to lash out at them for their obliviousness. She storms out of the bar, heading home for the night. Haruka , who came to Rika after she witnessed Rin’s outburst, introduces herself to her and, when Rika asks what she should do to fix her mess, suggests to leave her daughter be for now. Imani joined Wakana and Osako at the bar and has a friendly conversation about Osako’s costume. Kirin finds Miku biting her nails in a corner of the bar and assumes that the noise is getting to her. She’s actually suffering a panic attack due to her non-stop acting and the approaching contest. Once Uta and Io arrive to pick her up, Io immediately realizes what’s wrong with Miku and offers some of her Valium so she can perform on stage. While dismissive at first, Kirin asks Miku if she wants to take Io’s medicine, but she’s hesitant because she never took strong medicine before and is afraid of the side effects. When Imani starts her announcement for the last contest, Miku finally agrees while Uta tries to stall time.",
