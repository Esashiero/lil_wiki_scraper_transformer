        "synopsis": "Gym class has just concluded for the day, and Sensei and Ami have hung back in the gymnasium to clean up while the rest of the girls go to take a shower. The two talk about the fact that Ayane has somehow killed another janitor with her pitching arm thanks to dodgeball, and the fact that her being rich is the likely reason she's not already in jail, despite the deaths being entirely accidental. After telling Ami where to store everything, the two briefly talk about needing a third judge for the cooking competition, due to both Sensei and Sana being biased toward Ami and Ayane, respectively. Ami guesses Sensei's pick to be third judge correctly, that being Maya , and after a thinly veiled threat on Ami's part, the two return to cleaning. Meanwhile, Futaba is being harassed by Yumi as she's trying to enter the shower proper, and as the comments grow increasingly more derisive despite Futaba's attempts to maintain peace and Yumi's effort to appear civilized, Ayane quickly takes notice and walks over to the proceedings off the heels of a harsh threat from Chika from another part of the room. Ayane quickly figures out Futaba is harassing Yumi again, and having heard the conversation thanks to Yumi's loud voice and the build of the shower room, she takes off her towel and offers it to Yumi. When Yumi harshly tries to rebuke her, Ayane inquires as to Yumi's sexuality, after which point Yumi quickly loses the argument and is forced to take the towel. After a bit more banter, Futaba quickly thanking Ayane for the help, Ayane gives her some advice, and then walks off to go find another towel.",
