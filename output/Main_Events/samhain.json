After telling him about the Celtic festival of Samhain, Molly enlists Sensei's help in their planned raid on wherever Ayane 's father keeps the alcohol. As they sit in a courtyard with some beer, it occurs to Sensei that he doesn't know what will happen with Molly and Tsuneyo when the world resets, since they weren't in his class the first time. Tsuneyo is distressed to learn that she might have a new teacher and classmates soon. Molly tells him that, as their teacher, he should now give them some profound advice about life â€” he says something about life being a game where the point is to keep some lives saved up and be happy, which Molly and Tsuneyo find unexpectedly moving.",
