Tsuneyo doesn't see the mysterious shadowy figure beside her, and says that he doesn't see the ones beside him. Rin meets Otoha on the beach, and awkwardly makes her love confession (which Otoha knew was coming). To Rin's surprise, Otoha accepts. Otoha says that, unlike Rin, she took some time to figure out how she felt, and that Rin's haste made Otoha uncertain as to how real Rin's feelings were. Otoha still isn't sure that either of them know what they are doing, but is willing to try if Rin promises that itâ€™ll be only her.",
