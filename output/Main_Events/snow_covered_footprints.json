        "synopsis": "Unlike the last time the world reset, Sensei does not wake up in his classroom — he is still with Maya on the rooftop, only it is winter now. They go to Sensei's house, because Maya is going to spend the night with Ami and Ayane — they are pleased to see him, to Maya's irritation. It turns out that the world has reset directly to Christmas eve, and there is a party tomorrow. Upon hearing that Makoto is handling some of the preparations, Sensei asks if she is okay now, but Ami and Ayane don't remember that there was ever something wrong . Sensei concludes that the reset \"fixed\" Makoto, but wishes he knew what the problem had been. He asks about Molly and Tsuneyo to see whether the reset has undone their transfer into his class, but it hasn't. Later that evening, Ami and Ayane fall asleep on Sensei while watching movies, again to Maya's irritation.",
