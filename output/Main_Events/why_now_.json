        "synopsis": "During the night, Sensei suffers from the feeling of not being in control and visual hallucinations, so he decides to take a walk outside. After an indeterminable amount of time of walking, he meets Yuki and attempts to have a conversation with her. The conversation has a rough start due to Yuki not believing that he's currently chaperoning the girls from his class and him behaving like he's not fully there, but when he's asks again what she's doing here, he learns that she was visiting a NA meeting out of boredom, and Sensei tries once again to explain that he's chaperoning the girls from his class, including Yumi . Yuki wants to know if this is him finally admitting that something is going on between him and her daughter, but after denying it, he tells her about the dorm war. Yuki has a hard time believing that Yumi would want to participate in this, especially since she has any skills that could help her win a competition, but when Sensei explains that she competes against Io in who will cooperate first during the war, she declares her daughter will be victorious. When he asks why she's so sure about it, she explains that Yumi didn't have a lot of friends as a child and, therefore, would probably do anything to be included now. Sensei points out how her actions don't reflect such a desire for inclusion, but Yuki reminds him that Yumi has built up a reputation as a tough loner, and since trying to socialize with others goes against this image, she has to ignore her personal desires and keep up the act until she finally decides to change; however, she doesn't know if Io will ever change in that regard. Because of this, Sensei declares both of them enigmas, but Yuki tells him that they're just girls who still need to figure themselves out, a fact he should know by now â€“ He does, but he usually uses it for his own benefit. With this, Yuki decides to leave because she has a job interview in the morning. Sensei is surprised by this, and she explains that she visited bar that's on the brink of failure and might employ her despite her lack of experience, so she wants to give it a try. Once she's gone, Sensei takes out his phone to find his way back to the hotel, being able to figure out the route before his phone's battery dies. Back at the hotel, he runs into Futaba and Nodoka , both having changed back into their winter clothes. Sensei is confused on why they changed back, and Futaba explains that some of them had trouble sleeping and decided to go outside, with Rin and Otoha currently looking for playing cards in a convenience store. Nodoka asks him to see his room, wanting to determine if Futaba's recent claim about him and her having a close relationship is true, as she has a hard time believing it. Sensei wonders if she will abuse this knowledge, but Nodoka has no such intention as Futaba means everything to her. After some teasing, Futaba drags Nodoka up to Sensei's room with him following them.",
