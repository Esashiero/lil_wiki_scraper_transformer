        "synopsis": "Inside the bathroom Noriko ran off to, Kirin attempts to console her friend. She’s aware that she will do a poor job doing so, but still wants to help her regardless and asks if her being sad is related to what she learned about her sister . She admits this is case, being scared that Sensei will pick her sister over her yet again, and Kirin’s comments don’t help alleviating her fears. Kirin suggests to just have fun with Sensei instead of crying over the prospect of losing him, but she has no intention of doing this since it would be counterproductive to her wish, even if clinging to it makes it harder to get closer to him. Noriko points out that both of them know how it is to be the younger sister of a more popular and skilled older sister, and no matter how much effort both put into catching up to them, they’ll never achieve it. When Noriko proclaims her love for Sensei again, Kirin wonders if she has to stop fooling around with him to make her feel better, which she’s sure she can’t do at this point, but Noriko is fine with it, only pointing out that she can’t help her right now due to their differences in their interests – Noriko wants a passionate and genuine relationship with him, whereas Kirin only wants to satiate her own curiosity and boredom. Noriko has another emotional outburst and Kirin once again fails to provide any solace, and her comments only make Noriko worry that Kirin’s attitude will really bite her in the ass one day. During this, she learns that Miku starts to catch up to them as well, though Kirin doesn’t know if it’s due to her getting close to Sensei or if she’s just getting more curious on her own. Noriko calls her out for being unhelpful, but Kirin warned her she wouldn’t be but is at least trying to, something she would only do for people she cares about. Kirin finally convinces Noriko to get back to the party, but, suddenly, they hear someone entering the bathroom. While they try to make Noriko look more presentable after her crying fit, Yasu stands in the entrance and wonders if they can overcome the misery heading their way. The girls notice Yasu and ask why she’s here without Touka . Yasu admits that she was wandering around and got lost, seeing it as ironic that someone who guides lost souls got lost herself. Noriko offers to take Yasu back to the party, while Kirin, who appreciated Yasu’s costume until now, decides to stay behind.",
