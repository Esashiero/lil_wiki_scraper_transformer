        "synopsis": "\"So funny is the mockingbird\" starts the unseen narrator, who speaks to Sensei in an increasingly mocking and superior tone of voice. As he stares down at the spot where Maya once lay , it informs him that he has continuously misunderstood something since the beginning. And it's that while the \"worm\" that \"feeds\" on his brain may lead him to believe he's the main character in this story, he's nothing more than a piece of the falling action. The narrator informs him that, if their predictions are correct, the tragedy he just witnessed will shift him back into the place he belongs and transform him into \"The Collector\". They remind Sensei of the teachings of his mother and advise him to follow in her footsteps, lest he end up exactly like his father. Ayane arrives on the rooftop, shaken by the sudden shift into the apocalypse. She calls out to Sensei and Maya, hoping they've already arrived, and is distraught to find only the former kneeling wordlessly on the concrete. While at first, she believes this unresponsive state to be another case of him \"dreaming\", she soon realizes he's awake, and quickly throws out suggestions for how to make him feel better. All of these fail to provoke any reaction though, and she steps forward to get a closer look at him. The whole while, the unseen narrator continues to speak, mocking him for what they perceive to be a ridiculously childish reaction. As Ayane tries, again and again, to snap Sensei out of his nonverbal state, the narrator continues on and on, trying to goad him into reacting with threats as well. All of these fail to do anything, but Ayane is pulled away from Sensei when Makoto shows up as well, disoriented by her first visit to the end of the world. Ayane rushes over, assuring Makoto she'll answer any questions she has soon, but first asking if she's seen Maya at all tonight. After confirming she hasn't, and having her suggestion to call Maya instead shot down, both girls decide to wait and hope she appears. Ayane especially hopes this is the case, as even the possibility she won't hurts Sensei so much, a fact that Makoto tries to avoid thinking about. Before anyone can begin calming down, though, something appears before the two girls. A strange being, composed of miscellaneous objects and adored with a hat, declares them to be 'Interlopers' and demands their hall pass as proof of their admittance to the school rooftop. Obviously lacking one, the being, named ' Big Boi ', tries to make them leave, only stopping when Makoto reveals herself to be the Student Council President and, therefore, owning a key to the roof. Content with this, Big Boi drops the topic. Ayane tries to get the being to leave so she can begin to figure out how to initiate a reset. The being insists resetting is easy, demonstrating how itself.",
