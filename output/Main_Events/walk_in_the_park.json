        "synopsis": "While walking home in the afternoon, Sensei decides to make a detour through a park and winds up running into Makoto . Both are surprised to see the other, but Sensei quickly gives Makoto a backhanded compliment before asking why she's not at work, which Makoto replies to by saying normal business hours see basically zero profit for the store, so they don't bother opening at that time. Makoto tries to apologize shortly after for her ' outburst ', and tells Sensei to ignore anything she said in that encounter, only for Sensei to refute her point and tell her he does want to hang out, and to make plans. When he jokes about Makoto's nearly incessant desire to continue her studies, he is surprised to find Makoto has actually forbidden herself from studying for the duration of the afternoon. After Makoto gleefully acknowledges Sensei's desire to spend time with her in the park, the two sit down nearby a fountain, and Makoto brings up how weird it must look for a teacher and student to be hanging out in such a manner. Sensei thinks nothing of it, and Makoto makes a comment about how the city is constantly changing, never staying the same for long, such as how the Koi Cafe is actually a recent development. After Makoto mentions how she keeps a coffee pot in her dorm room, Sensei jokes how terrifying it must be for Miku to have caffeine in her system. Makoto acknowledges that Miku can be difficult to keep up with at times, and when she makes a comment about her grades, Sensei mentions he could always have Miku over for private tutoring, which Makoto questions the legality of. After a short conversation on Makoto's true intentions of having a study session at Sensei's apartment, the two part ways, and Sensei leaves to go about his evening. Unbeknownst to either of them, Yumi hides behind a tree a good distance away, having observed and heard the entire interaction.",
