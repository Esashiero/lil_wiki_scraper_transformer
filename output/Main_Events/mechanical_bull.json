She was considered the least likely person to do anything weird while waking Sensei, but finds it difficult to ignore his reaction to where she's sitting. Makoto enters, and doesn't believe Miku's protests that nothing was actually going on. Makoto then makes Sensei help prepare for the Halloween party, which takes most of the day.",
