As they sort through the candy, Yumi walks in, announcing her return from her father's. The girls celebrate, but not before Chika and Yumi discuss the Dorm Wars. Yumi agrees to take part, given the contest isnâ€™t anything she's uncomfortable with. Back with Sensei, he falls asleep, thinking about the exhaustion that the next few days will bring.",
