Sensei can choose to ask Ami for more information about the world around them. Afterward, the two encounter Maya , one of Ami’s best friends and another of Sensei’s students, and the three talk about Sensei’s sudden forgetfulness and Maya’s intense abhorrence, before Ami excuses the two of them and they head back to Sensei and Ami’s apartment. Once they return to the apartment, Ami suggests Sensei head to his room and look in the notebook of details he's kept of his students while she begins preparing dinner. He looks through and commits the student's names to memory, and has a brief discussion with Ami over tomorrow's class, before she heads back to the kitchen, while Sensei draws a bath for himself. Later, he heads to bed.",
