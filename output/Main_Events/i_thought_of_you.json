        "synopsis": "During another normal - the new normal, anyway - day in the classroom, Sensei thinks about the class' situation compared to the rest of the school, before deciding to take a nap. Near the back of the classroom, Rin is staring out the window and off into space, when she is suddenly surprised and flustered by Chika 's surprise appearance next to her desk. After a moment, Rin nervously asks Chika what she's up to, and Chika says she just wanted to check up on Rin, since she seemed lonely. The two talk about things they remember about each other from middle school, and both are pretty embarrassed, especially Chika, though Rin consoles her and tells her she looked pretty and pulled off green hair. Eventually, the topic diverts to Sensei and his new method of 'teaching'. They express a bit of concern over his sudden change, but eventually blow it off, figuring Ami will tell Rin about it if something comes up. After Chika leaves Rin to go back to her seat and do some studying, Rin turns and asks Futaba whether or not their conversation really happened. When Futaba confirms this, Rin, still frazzled, tells her she's going to take a nap, and to hit her with something to wake her up if she does something weird, and Futaba chuckles and commits to doing that if necessary.",
