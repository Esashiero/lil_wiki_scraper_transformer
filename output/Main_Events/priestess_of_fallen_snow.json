        "synopsis": "Imani , who's barely holding on to her sanity at this point, announces the final outdoor contest â€“ The five-legged race. In this competition, two contestants have to take a leg, or in this case an arm used as a leg since Imani was unable to get actual legs in time for the Dorm Wars, and try to get it past an obstacle and attach it on their respective one-legged mannequins to gain the win. The contestants, Ayane , Sana , Molly and Yasu , meet in the circle and exchange some words regarding their team composition, primarily Sana wearing a helmet to protect herself after what happened before and Yasu participating due to a \"stag beetle telling her she has to take place in this competition\". Meanwhile, Tsuneyo and Touka watch the contest from the side and are debating how strange this year's Dorm Wars is, though Tsuneyo telling her about a recent revelation makes her even more uncomfortable. The girls receive their \"legs\", with all of them having varying feelings regarding it, most notably Yasu who doesn't know if she's allowed to touch something like this when He hasn't finalized the tenets for the current season yet. Molly wonders if she can ask Him for instructions, but Yasu explains that she hasn't heard His voice for a while. She's worried that something has happened, but Molly assumes He will contact her again in due time. The contest begins, and the girls have to overcome their obstacle in the form of a crocodile named Catherine. While the girls try to get past it, Tsuneyo and Touka start a conversation after Touka makes a pun in regards to the arms the girls have to carry. Tsuneyo tries to make another joke, but fails and, when Touka complains about not being able to understand when the people around her are sincere or try to mess with her, claims that she just can't understand her unique brand of genius. Touka states how Yasu is also a genius in her own way, explaining that what she preaches is actually identical to a religion that was practiced in Kumon-mi, a religion that has been long forgotten and whose scriptures are almost non-existent, with the only prove of its existence being the few documents the Tsukioka family managed to archive. Tsuneyo sees this as suspicious, and while Touka can agree with this to an extent, she also sees a hidden genius inside of her, especially since almost all of her predictions actually come to pass. Back on the field, the girls managed to reach the mannequins with their \"legs\" and are trying to attach them. During this attempt, Yasu is feeling off, and while Molly assumes she's being affected by the unusually high amount of euphemisms they use and asks her to endure it, she falls into a trance, reveals a message from Him, and collapses in pain. Touka rushes to her side and tries to take care of her, with Imani getting the keys for the nurse's office and Ayane volunteering to help her. While the girls carry her to the nurse's office, Yasu states how she needs to save the lamb .",
