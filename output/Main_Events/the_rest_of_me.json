        "synopsis": "As Sensei 's led away from the beach by Makoto , he thinks to himself about how hard breathing has become as of late. The feeling drives him wild and he's reminded of a variety of things – He's reminded of how much has changed since their first trip to the beach and all the tragedies and developments between him and Makoto. It also reminds him that the better world is only a misstep away. When the two arrive in the first floor's room, Makoto tackles him, revealing her true intentions. He repeatedly tries to talk her down, unsuccessful as she doesn’t care about anything serious right now. He eventually pushes through, opening up about Maki 's suspicions about Makoto's change in behavior. This isn't enough to dissuade Makoto from continuing her attack, but Sensei's insistence that they talk breaks her stubbornness. Makoto begrudgingly backs down and the two take seats across from each other. Sensei first explains that while Maki's unsure of the exact source of Makoto's behavioral change, she's pinpointed the cause. Makoto fails to understand why it matters at all to him, especially since he isn't part of the family. He refutes this by asserting that he is Maki's friend and that if things get any worse, it could prevent them from seeing each other anymore, confessing how important Makoto has become to him, which completely blindsides her. Next, he clarifies her misunderstanding about resets, telling her that while certain memories get erased, memories pertaining to relationships usually aren't, which is why they were able to get so close. Therefore, this issue with Maki isn't going to disappear unless they do something about it. After Sensei makes some surprisingly compelling arguments why she should help her mother, Makoto agrees that she'll try to talk to her about the situation and, after Sensei briefly scolds her for telling Ami about resets, the two pick up where they left off earlier. Out on the beach, Maya 's staring out into the ocean, being soon joined by Ami. She immediately brings up the recent Old District incident , reasserting that she misses Maya and Ayane both and wants to know why they're abandoning her. Maya says she feels the same, but also that she's unable to talk about why they've been excluding her. The two girls muse how difficult growing up is, and if they'll ever be as close as they once were. As they begin to banter, Ami catches Maya in a lie and presses her about not lying in the future. Intimidated, Maya promises to tell the truth from now on and Ami immediately swaps back to normal.",
