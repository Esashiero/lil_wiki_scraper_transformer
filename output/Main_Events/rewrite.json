Since God is dead, however, a new, better world must be written. Sensei supposedly wakes up to find Maya giving him a handjob. He feels like he is dying, like the \"wires of his brain\" are being wrapped around one another. He decides that Maya must be a dream, but that it wouldn't hurt to play along. He wakes up a few hours later, but it seems that the world is broken .",
