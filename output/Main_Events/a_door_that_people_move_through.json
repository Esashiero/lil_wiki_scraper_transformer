        "synopsis": "Sensei leaves the class and is greeted by Maya , who wants to talk with him about how the confidence she showed on the roof was unfounded due to recent events . Sensei asks if the other school collapsing was caused by the reset, but Maya negates this, claiming that a change of this magnitude never happened over the countless resets she witnessed. This level of change worries her due to her being accustomed to the same events occurring in every cycle, and while Sensei considers consoling her, he knows that anything he does will backfire due to her not caring about his pity and him being unable to relate to her struggle. Maya tells him that she wanted to tell him about her worries and that she's confident that it's a temporary anomaly that will be corrected with the next reset, suggesting that he shouldn't get too attached to the new girls that will join their class during the migration process. With this, both make their way to the exit. When they reach the lockers, Sensei asks if everything really will return to normal after the next reset, and she thinks it won't, because while the people in the city don't change much between resets, their environment continues to change over time. She believes it's more likely that the reconstruction of the school will be finished after the next reset, and the migrated students will be sent back to their original school. She notes how this entire situation still feels unreal to her, and Sensei can see where she's coming from, even though everything he witnesses already feels unreal to him. His thoughts are interrupted when Maya notices someone familiar outside and, after hearing a familiar voice and name, Uta enters the school and greets both of them. She wonders if Sensei is her new teacher and is elated when he confirms it. She promises to keep his relationship with Maya a secret, and after Maya leaves when she failed to correct her, Sensei manages to convince her that he and Maya aren't close in any way. With this out of the way, Uta reaffirms how happy she is being transferred into his class, but requests not to be called out for any questions he might ask in class. Sensei explains that she doesn't need to worry about that because he lets her do whatever she wants, having to clarify that this isn't him giving her special treatment but the way he runs the entire class. Now even more fired up, Uta sprints to her meeting with the principal to discuss the details of her transfer, though ends up running down the wrong hallway, and while Sensei would usually be unhappy about another obnoxiously loud girl joining his class, he's willing to make an exception for Uta.",
