        "synopsis": "Touka approaches Sensei , who's elected to stand off to the side as the party continues rather than speak with the class. While he tries to play it off with jokes, Touka easily sees through his jokes and knows something is wrong. He continues to avoid explaining himself, even as she presses her concern, though does ask that she leaves the party with him and comfort him until he feels better again â€“ He adds that should he never feel better, he wants her to remain with him forever. Touka admits that while the idea is appealing to her, she won't play along, recognizing that doing such wouldn't be enough to distract him for more than an hour. He instead asks for advice on what he should do to feel like he belongs, hesitating when asked if he means at the party or something else. Seeing the loneliness and misery in his eyes, Touka expresses her sympathy, likening his state to Yasu as both share similar feelings of emptiness and are longing for something unobtainable. She tells him that, while she's not the person who will cure this spell of loneliness, she'll remain with him until that person does show up, though Sensei's comment on how Ami would be better suited for this causes some lighthearted banter and a discussion about Touka's apartment complex between them. Kirin , overhearing the part about Touka's status as Sensei's landlady , joins the conversation, intent on making mischief. Both of them try to get Kirin to leave them alone, but she remains intent on inserting herself between them, claiming she wants to take advantage of this sudden piece of \"blackmail\". Touka tries to downplay how advantageous knowing about Sensei's apartment is, but when Kirin asks if Ami knows about the situation, they both relent and ask her what she wants in exchange for her silence. Her proposed \"prize\" ends up falling through and Touka takes her leave, with Sensei asking her to remain by so she can fulfill her promise once he's finished with Kirin. Now alone with her, Sensei asks her why she's bothering him right now. She counters this with a question of her own, asking why he's so desperately asking Touka to stick with him tonight. He fills her in that, since this morning , he's felt awful and wants the comfort Touka brings to help him weather the feeling. Kirin offers to help herself, but he turns her down, explaining that Touka is probably also incapable of helping and that he'll be content on his own for the night. Hearing this, she asks Sensei to at least tell Noriko about all this, so she isn't left waiting for him all night. He hesitates to do this, saying she reminds him of someone else he wants to see, which only makes his feelings worse.",
