        "synopsis": "After being driven to Sara 's bar, Sensei decides to spend some time with the other adults at the counter, waiting for the final contest to start. He joins Maki and Haruka first and learns that the contest is a fashion show, disappointed that his initial guess was wrong, even though he knew it would be. Makoto and Uta ask for their attention and announce that the fashion show will begin in a few minutes, while Sensei notices that they somehow managed to set up a stage in Sara's bar, but between his students being surprisingly competent in organizing the events in two days and everything he witnessed already, he just accepts it. He's then called over by Sara, who's happy that her business is booming for once. He wonders how she's still in business with her letting the girls drink, and Osako assumes she can afford it since Wakana finances her business to a significant degree. He introduces Wakana and Osako to Sara and lets it slip that Osako is working at the maid cafe. Osako reprimands him for spreading her secret, but he assures her Sara's trustworthy due to her working as a bartender, and she already knew about her secondary job, she only didn't recognize her without the uniform. The contest starts and the designers of both floors, Ami and Ayane for the first, who're joined by Rin to ensure the safety of the contestants, and Molly and Uta for the second, are introduced before the show begins. Sensei has to make a decision, having a hard time doing so since both of them look equally good, and picks the one he thinks looks slightly better. With the contest over, Sara starts the after party, Wakana decides to talk to Sana before leaving, and Touka arrives only to notice Yasu's injuries.",
