        "synopsis": "Sensei continues his greetings, coming up to Makoto and Miku , both of whom are enjoying the night by talking. With Sensei's sudden appearance though, Makoto immediately shifts into lecturing him about his recklessness regarding Miku's drug scare . Miku and Sensei both try to weasel out of the conversation but Makoto repeatedly shuts these attempts down and begins to chastise Sensei for refusing to bring this issue to her earlier. Miku tries to defend him by claiming he didn't know about it either, but Sensei himself confesses that he knew the whole time and was simply too scared to do anything about it – He says he's sorry and that nothing like it will happen again. Makoto's taken aback by this sudden show of transparency, inquiring into why he's acting so differently tonight. He explains that, despite her suspicions, nothing is causing it and that he's simply trying to be honest with her because she's been courteous enough to give him chance after chance when he feels he hasn't deserved even one – He apologizes again, this time to both girls for having to put up with someone as horrible as him. While happy with this honesty, both girl's moods drop at the sudden bout of self-deprecation, expressing their concern for his well-being. He confesses that, since he woke up today, he's felt awful and can hardly focus on anything. Meanwhile, off to the side, Noriko tries to sell Chika and Yumi on her plan to fight back against \"malicious\" fashion corporations, having recruited Kirin as backup. The four all throw banter back and forth, eventually leading to Kirin revealing her sudden change in personality to the group, claiming it's due to a certain someone's intervention. The conversation drifts to something uncomfortable for Yumi, though, and she angrily protests for a change in topic – She immediately rescinds this complaint when Kirin suggests they sing to her for her birthday. Chika intervenes to stop the girls from teasing her more about it, and the conversation comes to an end as Noriko receives a call.",
