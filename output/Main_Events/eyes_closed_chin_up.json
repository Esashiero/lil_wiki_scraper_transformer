        "synopsis": "A poem is read, with the speaker claiming the one who previously recited it was \"eaten by the sun\". Another \"guest host\" interrupts said speaker though and instead talks about an episode from a TV show they seem to like. Their review is nonsensical and unstructured, speckled with random reminders to ignore Yasu . Back on the beach, Touka asks Yasu what it is she said to Sana , but she can’t remember anything. Exhausted, Touka drops the topic and guides Yasu away so they can prepare for the upcoming survival contest. Meanwhile, Sensei stands off to the side with Tsuneyo and Yumi , both of whom have taken up their post as bodyguards. Yumi complains about how boring the position is, while Tsuneyo doesn't mind, claiming she's been considering a career in security since her attempts at stand-up have failed. Yumi quips that she'll be hard-pressed to find employment since every place that she's applied for has turned her down. While Tsuneyo attempts to give her advice, Sensei asks about the specifics of her interviews, learning that Yumi's been using her real name on all applications. She fails to see the problem with this, having to be told that her family's Yakuza connections are probably leading to every business cutting contact. Unsure of what to do, Sensei tells her to use his last name instead, something she refuses to do. Uta takes up the mic, beginning the commentary to kick off the survival contest. She adds that, on top of the aforementioned one, tonight will also include the swimsuit contest to get both of the \"dangerous\" contests out of the way. Gesturing behind her, she showcases both survival competitors getting ready. While Uta answers questions from the audience, Molly finishes her adjustments on Ayane 's blindfold. Ayane, meanwhile, is on the verge of a panic attack from all the accumulating stress. This panic boils over when Molly reveals she won't be her escort tonight, with Ami walking over and claiming that role. Ayane tries to get Sensei or Maya as her guide instead, but Ami claims that they’re occupied right now and only she can do it since she signed their waiver. She also fails to see why Ayane should be scared when she won't hurt her and only wants to talk things out with her like she did with Maya . Uta blows her whistle, signaling the start of the contest. Picking up the commentary once again, she runs over the rules of the contest for the audience. Touka interrupts the commentary though, voicing her extreme displeasure at the idea of this contest and asks if it can be substituted with a safer one; Ayane agrees. Uta informs both parties that it's too late to back out now and to speak their \"final words\" to their respective floors. Ayane tries to get Sensei over to her so she can speak to him alone but ends up having these attempts foiled by Yumi, Tsuneyo, and Ami. Instead, she proclaims her love for him aloud before she's led into the forest.",
