As they reach the steps of the church, Yasu stops them all, and further segments the group, stating only she, Sensei , Sana , and Rin can head inside, claiming it to be her God's decision. Otoha tries to protest but relents after Touka insists they honor her wishes. Inside the church, the contest starts, with Rin gaining a clear lead over Yasu, mostly due to her lack of confidence in the answers she’s ‘receiving’. This loop continues, Yasu providing increasingly vague excuses for why she can't answer. Rin also struggles as the questions ramp up in difficulty. Once the girls are asked about the name of Sensei's mother, Rin finally fails to find an answer. Yasu answers perfectly.",
