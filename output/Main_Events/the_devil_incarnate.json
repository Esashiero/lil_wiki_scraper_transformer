Later, Maya joins them and immediately engages in a verbal spar with Sensei, later attributing it to a lack of sleep at \"the start of a cycle\". Ami attempts to correct Sensei's grammar like he had done to her earlier in the conversation, only for Sensei to use reverse psychology to halfheartedly dismiss her. Afterward, Ami makes several offhand comments that disgust Maya, before the three arrive at school.",
