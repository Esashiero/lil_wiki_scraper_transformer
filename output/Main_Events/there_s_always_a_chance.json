        "synopsis": "Sensei leaves school after another day of work, and meets the Kanda sister in front of the entrance, with Kirin pretending to mug him while Karin is her usual shy self around him. Once they drop the act, Kirin wonders why he's leaving early, and he explains that he intends to skip his office hours on Friday when the nurse can do the same. Kirin asks him if he already got the news, and when he makes it clear that he didn't, she announces her transfer into his class, claiming she annoyed her current teacher so much that they finally decided to get rid of her. he has a hard time believing her, primarily because she could've just asked for a transfer instead of annoying her teachers, but she claims that doing it the formal way would've been boring and suspicious. Karin doesn't understand what her sister means with the second point, but when Kirin explains it, she gets angry, she states that while such rumors wouldn't hurt Sensei's reputation, though he doesn't think that his reputation is so low for anyone to ignore these rumors, it will still destroy Kirin's. Kirin accuses Karin of only thinking about her own reputation, which she denies, and the following argument ends when Kirin abruptly stops. After a moment of silence, Sensei asks if these kinds of argument are common between them, and Kirin sarcastically confirms this before flirting with him. Karin, after asking Sensei to take good care of her sister, takes her leave. Sensei feels like Kirin went to far when Karin was just looking out for her, but Kirin brushes it off as Karin just fulfilling her duty as an older sister and instead guides him to a less open part of the entrance to discuss some details about her transfer. Sensei is still unsure why she even decided to transfer, considering that being in his presence would make him less interesting to her, a fact Kirin just realizes. Her resolve seems to waver, but the transfer is already finalized, and she will be officially joining his class on the coming Wednesday. He feels like her transfer makes their deal null and void, because Kirin doesn't need to do anything to slack off in class now, but Kirin demands that they still have to do her part of the deal before this agreement ends. Suddenly, Kirin's mood gets rather somber, confessing that odd things happened all day, from her sleeping in, to her asking for a transfer, and now questioning her resolve, though comes to the conclusion that she probably won't be bored in his class. She confirms that he will visit her once she moved into his class' dorm and takes her leave to sort some of her remaining feelings out. Meanwhile, Sensei digests the news, wondering if this is really alright when the migration process is still going, but concludes that it doesn't matter since Kirin joining his class will at least make things more interesting.",
