        "synopsis": "Sensei is sitting in his office, having to sort through paperwork regarding the migration of students from Kumon-Mi Academy after its collapse . After he internally complains about how nonsensical certain aspects of their education system are, he intents to wait for something interesting to happen, which occurs a moment later when an unknown woman enters his office and announces her desire to die with no context. The woman introduces herself as Wakana Watabe , who happens to be the teacher of Molly 's and Tsuneyo 's former class. After venting her frustrations about the migration in a nihilistic manner, she asks if she can transfer misfit students to his class again if some of them are assigned to hers during the migration process. She thinks he would be the best choice for those, having heard how he runs his class and how close he is with his students, something that could get him fired, but when he asks if she intends to use this fact to blackmail him into accepting these potential miscreants, she denies it, claiming it would be too tedious for her to report him. Additionally, after Wakana allows him to use her first name, she doesn't care if he's a failure of a teacher, something he tries to defend himself from, but can't. Suddenly, Makoto requests permission to enter, with Sensei hoping that she will back him up. After entering and bringing in even more documents regarding the migration, Makoto is surprised to see Wakana in his office and confirms that Sensei isn't as bad as the rumors may suggest. Wakana takes her word for it, because Makoto is one of the few students she actually likes, and while some of her comments about his uncouth behavior and extracurricular activities make her suspicious, she doesn't care about those overall. Makoto asks if Wakana could take her leave so she can discuss the documents with Sensei, and Wakana does so after voicing her complaints about the migration one last time. Once she's gone, Makoto takes notice of them being on first name basis, which reminds him of her reaction when he did this with her for the first time . She tries to move on, wanting to discuss what needs to be done for the migration, which boils down to her doing basically everything, and warns him that they will get one addition to the class by the name of Uta Ushibori . Apparently, this girl struggles with her studies and will join their class in the following day, being the only who was assigned to his class. Sensei questions this choice, but Makoto quickly realizes why he does and chastizes him for thinking about his own amusement when the new girl might've been seriously affected by the collapse of her school. Sensei feels like being in his class might help in that case, but Makoto points out that Uta might actually be as serious about her studies as she is. He deflects this by claiming that she's rather unique in this regard, which she decides to take as a compliment.",
