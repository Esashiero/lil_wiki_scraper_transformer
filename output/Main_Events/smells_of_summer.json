        "synopsis": "Sensei drags his feet along the beach, monologing about his personality as he searches for Noriko. He finds her, nestled next to a campfire with her guitar. As he says hello, she talks to him about how easy it would’ve been to have a relationship with him like Kirin’s, but that she wants more than something superficial. As Sensei takes a seat, he makes her promise to keep her usual melancholic rants about the distance between them to herself. She promises and asks him to pass her the guitar. Now sat in front of the fire, the two of them talk about Noriko’s original plans to be the backup singer for Niki’s concert, but choose to spend the whole trip with the class instead. Sensei finds the idea that she’d compromise on her usual principles for personal-betterment impressive, complimenting her on her resolve. Noriko changes the topic, explaining that the reason she ever got into music in the first place was because of how deeply she loved his poetry. She hopes that, someday, she could make music as representative of her as Sensei’s poetry was of him. Gathering her courage, she asks if she can finish the song she wrote for him . He lets her, and Sensei silently listens along. Once the song finishes, Noriko tells Sensei to close his eyes. He complies, and the two of them spend some time alone. Near the end, Sensei starts to blackout, finally coming to when he receives a text from Maya. He tells Noriko goodbye and rushes over to Maya.",
