        "synopsis": "Sensei has been called by Makoto , along with Miku , to the library for a study session to help bring Miku's grades back up. On the way, he laments another boring day and revisits his own internal dialogue over his presence in the world. Upon entering the library, he goes straight to Makoto and Miku's study area, catching them on the tail end of a lesson of the mathematical importance of pi. Miku, upon being asked how the session is going, complains that Makoto's tutoring on this specific topic has made her hungry more than taught her anything, and Sensei makes a suggestive comment which Makoto quickly blows off, telling Miku to focus. She says she's trying to learn more about biology, and Sensei makes more suggestive comments, which annoy Makoto and fly right over Miku's head, and Makoto takes the tutoring back over. Sensei flees into the hallway over Makoto's indignant shouts and runs into Chika , who hasn't been taking the tutoring very seriously, but before she can try to cover herself on said absence, Sensei shushes her, intent on avoiding Makoto. Chika asks if he needs her to mace Makoto, an idea which Sensei quickly shuts down. Chika hastily shoves the two of them into a nearby ladies' restroom, and Sensei comments how he shouldn't be in here. Chika says it's fine, but becomes flustered when she rhetorically asks Sensei if he'd make a move on her in the situation, only for him to easily turn the circumstances back onto her. After a few minutes of awkward silence, Chika blushing the entire time, the two leave, and Sensei goes about his day.",
