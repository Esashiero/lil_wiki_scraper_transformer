        "synopsis": "Sensei has \"zoned out\" again, and discovers a restaurant sanctuary. Outside, a council of plants has gathered to discuss the probability of furthering Sensei's development, but Sensei's intrusion interrupts them. Inside, Sensei finds Makoto and Touka — they are concerned about him standing around looking lost and talking to plants, although he seems better now. Chika arrives, and then Yumi is there, and everything is strange again. Then Chika really arrives, and they have a meal. As they leave the restaurant, Sensei feels that a chunk of his life has been ripped out of him. Chika notices that he looks \"not okay\" — she leads him into the woods, and might decide to do something for him there.",
