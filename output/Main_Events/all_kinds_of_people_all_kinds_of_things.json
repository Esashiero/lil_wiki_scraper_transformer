        "synopsis": "While trying to figure out what to do during his lunch break, Sensei is approached by Uta , who has brought Wakana along with her. Uta wants to get Io 's transfer going, though Wakana fails to see what the issue is when she already agreed to transfer any student he wants and only needs him, or rather Makoto , to do the necessary paperwork. After Sensei shares a personal conversation with both girls, Uta gets fed up and wants to get the process going, being sick of living in her dorm room and having to deal with Molly and Tsuneyo 's antics by herself. Uta finally lets go of Wakana, with Sensei being a bit worried that any kind of physical contact between teachers and students are prohibited, and both Sensei and she leave to look for Makoto in the cafeteria and the roof respectively. Instead of Makoto, Sensei finds Io on his way to the roof, with her looking out of a window with a forlorn look on her face. While he wonders what causes this expression and appreciates how strangely beautiful she looks in this moment, she takes notice of his presence. Sensei asks her why she's nnot in the cafeteria, assuming her not being hungry is the primary reason, and she admits it's both this and the fact that her initial excitement died down once she realized that she's still surrounded by strangers once she changes classes. Their deal comes up, and Sensei notes how she should've kept Uta's secret that day. Io is aware that it was wrong of her to reveal it, but she isn't a fan of hiding certain things from others, seeing the need to hide so many secrets as tiring, which is something Sensei can relate to as someone who has way too many secrets himself. He notices how different she acts when she's without Uta, and Io tells him that Uta is all she has, though she keeps the number of friends she has low on purpose to avoid learning secrets from others. This is why she likes Uta so much – She's very open with her feelings and doesn't require Io to keep many secrets. Sensei is confused by her openness, which kinda contradicts her earlier statements, but Io clarifies that, even though she doesn't want many friends, she still needs people around her to satiate her needs, like, right now, she needs someone who watches the falling snow with her. She doesn't know if them getting closer will be a good thing for either of them, but she at least wants to try it, especially because she has a hard time keeping him away on an emotional level. Their conversation is interrupted by an annoyed Uta, who managed to find Makoto and asked her take care of the transfer, which, according to her, might happen the following day. Io is thankful towards Sensei for taking her in, but her flirting annoys Uta even more and she expects some attention as well, with Io caressing her head. The three spend the remaining time in the cafeteria, with Sensei trying to understand what Io meant with her needing “high maintenance in the lowest maintenance way”, but decides to figure it out once she's officially a part of his class.",
