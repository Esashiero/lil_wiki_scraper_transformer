        "synopsis": "Inside the dojo of the Amamiya estate, Ayane welcomes everyone who didn't go to see the date war and explains the contest – On both sides of the dojo is a door that leads into a “scary room” that was prepared by Ami and Molly respectively. Both rooms are filled with things that are supposed to scare both contestants, and whoever manages to stay inside their room longer, wins. Maya is surprised to hear it's only one room, and Ayane explains that she spent most of her money to renovate the dojo and so they only could afford one room for each contestant. Since this implies that there won't be a lot to see, Maya wants to know how they can tell if it's safe for them to exit, and Ayane, not having thought about it, suggests to wait until someone knocks on their door. While the contestants enter their respective room, the following interactions take place: Inside Maya's room, she aimlessly walks around in the dark for minutes on end before she finds something. A projector starts, illuminating an eery room , and shows something only meant for Maya. She's shocked by what's shown to her, apparently showing frames that shouldn't exist anymore, while Angels mock her in the background. She gets desperate when someone initiates the factory reset of a certain terminal, which is most likely Sensei's terminal , and Maya desperately pleas for the reset to be aborted, only for it to be ignored. Before the timer hits zero, the initiation of the reset stops, and Maya is congratulated for passing the test of courage. Stepping outside her room, Ami asks Maya what she thought of her work, apparently having decorated the room with different horror-related items, because she couldn't think of anything else to scare her. She also informs her that she won, because Tsuneyo ran out of her room after 30 seconds when a trap ruined a bowl of ramen. Shell-shocked, Maya decides to return to the dorm and lay down.",
