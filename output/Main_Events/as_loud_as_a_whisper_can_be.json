Molly and Tsuneyo report that they talked to the principal about keeping the class together next year — the answer was non-committal, and Sensei decides to ask Makoto if she knows more. When Makoto wakes up, however, she is behaving strangely — Sensei thinks that she hasn't had much sleep and has been crying. She claims to be the same serious, diligent girl as normal, but seems apathetic and reckless. Miku , very concerned for her friend, drags Makoto away to try to sort things out.",
