He immediately runs into Rin and Molly, who arrived early in the morning to make the most of their holidays. He catches up with them before the two run off after Rin manages to make Molly embarrass herself. Nearby, Sensei spots Tsuneyo, who he didn't expect to see due to her work. He runs into Yumi next, who had been spending the day by herself. As the two of them begin to argue, Futaba joins them to check in with Sensei. She soon leaves to change, and Sensei reprimands Yumi for being an asshole to her again. As Futaba and Sensei continue their conversation, Makoto blows her whistle, calling him so they can check-in at the hotel.",
