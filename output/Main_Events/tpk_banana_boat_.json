Otoha knows about Rin's scars and her history with Chika , and she feels that one wrong move might make Rin very unhappy. She says that Rin has behaving oddly lately, and thinks that this might be the \"calm before the storm\", but she doesn't know what the storm will be. She wants Sensei to ask Rin to text her. After Otoha has gone, Molly appears. She is aware of Rin's feelings for Otoha, and is sad that her own chances don't look good, but says that she'll \"just have to make someone else happy\" instead.",
