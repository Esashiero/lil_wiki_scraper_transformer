As Nodoka’s perversion starts to slip in, Touka reminds her that she’s still banned from playing after the last time she played . Ayane also takes the time to establish some ground rules to keep Kirin from going too far. The group is surprised to see Maya sticking around, but she says she’s only here as her original plans just fell through unexpectedly.",
