        "synopsis": "Sensei takes a few minutes behind the restroom to calm down from Kirin ’s and Miku ’s relentless and partly unintended teasing . He intends to leave his hiding place, but Kirin managed to find him after he got away. She wants to know if he did something with Miku, because she’s very fond of him and Kirin never saw her getting that close to another man, but he tells her that he hasn’t done anything with her. He asks her why she thinks that he would be close with his students and she makes him aware that his excitement came back when she arrived, which he hasn’t noticed until she pointed it out. Feeling uncomfortable in her company, he wants her to leave, which she takes offense to as she only wanted to spend some time with him, especially now that they have an agreement , but he reminds her that neither of them have seen the benefits of their agreement yet. After realizing that, Kirin checks if the coast is clear and offers to take care of his situation, even offering to trick Miku into helping her, but Sensei doesn’t see that happening since she isn’t that gullible. He assumes that there’s a catch involved, especially since getting caught would seriously damage his relationship with the other girls, but Kirin assures him that she’s just in the mood and that he doesn’t need to worry about losing his reputation. Sensei considers if he should take her up on her offer or not.",
