She asks why he is without a young girl, since he always had one with him on their previous meetings â€” she suspects him of involvement in a human trafficking ring. His explanation that he is a teacher does not convince her. They talk about how Kaori works in so many different places, and whether she has any hobbies. Sensei tells her that she needs some more interesting things to do, and that he could show her some. She accepts, giving him her phone number and some of her pizza.",
