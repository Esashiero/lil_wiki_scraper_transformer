        "synopsis": "After helping Sara decorate her bar and getting a stuffed bear as Miku 's gift , Sensei arrives at the hotel, finding Chika and Tsubasa chatting in the lobby. He asks why the latter is here and learns that she'll be taking care of Chinami and her daughter in a separate hotel room. She promises that his \"future sister-in-law\" will be fine, which causes him to briefly \"black out\". Both women notice this and ask if he’s okay, but he moves on and wants to know where Miku is so he can give her her gift. Chika points out that the exchange happens as a group event later and he'll have to figure out what to do with it in the meantime. Tsubasa decides to leave and start her babysitting role, reminding him to look after Chika in her stead. After awkwardly staring at each other, Sensei asks Chika if she's fine, worried after Chinami recently confessed that she hadn't been sleeping well. She confirms this as true, but assure him it's just a result of her trying to adjust and how she'll be fine as she's endured worse things before. She does, unsubtly, ask for a confirmation of his devotion and Sensei, feeling generous due to Christmas, gives her one. Leaving Chika behind, he makes his way to the hotel room and meets Futaba and Touka on the way. He hands the bear to Touka, who initially believes it’s a present for her but isn’t surprised to learn that he just wants her to hold it until the exchange. When Futaba asks why he wants her to do that, Touka explains that he likes to torment her for unknown reasons, but he assures her he only likes to take advantage of her kindness. Sensei does it again by telling her she startled the bear by yelling at him, which she falls for. After Touka explained her reason for thinking the bear might have feelings, she and Futaba acknowledge how many similarities they found between them during their conversation. Sensei mentions that one similarity is their body types, making both mad at him. He decides to leave after managing to convince Touka to look after the bear by taking advantage of her kindness again. While she doesn’t mind watching over it, she requests he check on Yasu , because she seems to be hypnotized by the karaoke machine and hasn't reacted to anything else. He agrees and offers Futaba to check on her roommate as well, but she doesn’t think this is necessary.",
