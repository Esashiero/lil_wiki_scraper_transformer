        "synopsis": "After managing to fix the key to his room , Sensei leaves his home before what’s happening around him affects his already suffering mind even more. Once he gets outside, he is greeted by a choir of angels, some in colors of people he knows, and the Happy-version of Ami . Sensei celebrates his victory before Happy-Ami guides him to the school. After walking through the streets and a quick detour to a hardware store to look for a new lock for Sensei’s bedroom door, they reach the school way ahead of schedule. Since Sensei is still being hungry, they decide to go to the cafeteria to get some eggs to eat. While he eats, Ami wants to read him another poem she wrote , but she’s interrupted when the PA system turns on and Ayane ’s voice comes through, begging Sensei to find her in the staff room. Having been snapped out of his debilitated mental state, Sensei leaves to follow her call, leaving an irate Happy-Ami behind. Entering the staff room, Ayane, scared and crying, wants to know what’s going on since she walked through the entire city looking for him and noticed that no one’s around anymore. Sensei tries to calm her down, but ends up scaring her even more after explaining that it's the end of the world. Realizing he's not helping, he lets her catch her breath first to calm down. He reminds her of their earlier talk and how she was apparently wrong, but Ayane adamantly claims that she wasn’t. She begs him for an explanation, and after Sensei repeats what Maya already told her, she slowly accepts it as real, especially after remembering the hints he gave her in the past. After getting her up to speed, he makes it clear they need to get to the rooftop soon, but Ayane advises him to change into something more decent first, as he only now realizes that he isn’t wearing his usual clothes for once. After a quick change in his office, Sensei takes Ayane up the stairs to the roof. Ayane feels uneasy and doesn’t want to, but he tells her that it’s necessary since death will be the least of their problems if they don’t. She realizes that he was referring to their memories and how he really has no memories of their past anymore, starting to panic as the reality of their past being erased sinks in. Sensei holds her close and tries to console and encourage her, which ends up working when he acknowledges their relationship as important and genuine. Walking up the last flight of stairs, Sensei thinks about telling Maya how much he relishes their relationship as well, but once he reaches the roof, he instead has to face one shocking truth – Maya didn’t make it.",
