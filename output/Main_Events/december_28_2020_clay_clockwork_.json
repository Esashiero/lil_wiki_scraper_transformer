        "synopsis": "Having succeeded in recruiting both Yumi and Tsuneyo to the “Rooftop Apocalypse Squad” meeting, Sensei informs Maya and Ayane , wanting to know when the sleepover takes place as he starts to worry about losing one of them. With Maya needing more time to come up with a way to keep Ami occupied, Ayane suggests to do it on the upcoming Sunday so Ami isn’t alone during New Years. Feeling too anxious to do anything else, Sensei spends the next two days completely holed up inside his room, ignoring all text messages unrelated to the reset. The day of the sleepover rolls around. Sensei silently notices that Ami is having a slumber party with Sana , even though she was hesitant at first. He understands why she agreed in the end and admits that he would’ve agreed as well, but stops this train of thought as he’s not in the mood. After an awkward beginning, Maya begins to answer questions both newcomers have left and gives more detailed explanations of the concepts Sensei mentioned. After catching them up to speed, Maya gets back to speculating, feeling that the best-case scenario would be only one of the new girls making it through the reset, as it’d reveal more information. Ayane is confused by this statement, feeling it’d be best if everyone made it with them. Maya admits while it might sound nice, both Tsuneyo and Yumi making it to the rooftop wouldn’t answer anything – In addition, if either one of them makes it, it’s essentially a sentence to purgatory. As someone who has spend a very long time in this cycle, she knows all too well that eternal youth becomes a curse if you’re trapped in an illusion. Tsuneyo interjects, admitting that while it’s obvious Maya has gone through this year a lot, her memory isn’t any more reliable than theirs – If memories can be replaced or transplanted unknowingly, it’s equally as possible that Maya’s experiences are all fabricated. Taken aback, Maya has no counter, ending the conversation by reminding them all to simply be skeptical. Ayane takes note of Sensei’s silence and tries to reel him back into the conversation. He dismisses his silence as exhaustion and goes to make coffee, getting lost in thought while doing so, whereas Tsuneyo leaves the room to make a phone call. Yumi uses the opportunity to ask how she can tell that the reset occurs. Maya tells her that she’ll notice the moment it happens and, if she doesn’t or is asleep, it’s only important for them to be in the same room to fin each other quickly, though Ayane reminds her that she couldn’t see her last time . She acknowledges that, but thinks they will be fine a long as Sensei is with them. Eventually, Tsuneyo returns, having to abruptly leave the slumber party due to a mysterious odor coming from her family’s shop. Disappointed but understanding, Sensei bids her goodbye, offering to tell the others the news himself. Tsuneyo takes her leave as Sensei turns around.",
