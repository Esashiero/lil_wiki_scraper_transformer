        "synopsis": "Sensei is awoken the next morning by Ayane , who nervously tells him to get up as things outside have changed. Stepping out from their tent, he finds the previously surrealist scenery has been replaced with the normal sky, clouds, and sun â€“ Despite this supposed return to normalcy though, Kumon-mi is still missing all its people, at least according to Ayane's quick search. Beginning to fear that the world has been improperly reset, or some other unforeseen incident has occurred, Sensei becomes increasingly snappy and pessimistic. Ayane's cautious optimism is enough to help ground him, though, and the two take off into town in hopes that they can find Maya or anyone else. The two walk through the empty halls of Kumon-mi High , both unsettled. Ayane herself finds the empty halls extremely surreal, having grown so used to the expected chaos of the apocalypse that she's uncomfortable with something so normal. Sensei points out how even this is abnormal, a sentiment that makes the exhaustion of being pulled from incident to incident settle in. She quips that perhaps she is the \"unluckiest girl in the world\", something both of them agree Maya would snap back to with her trademark cold wit. They reflect on the last words they said to Maya, or at least try to as Sensei cannot remember what they were . Now outside, Sensei suggests they immediately head for the school dorms, as that is where Maya was last time she vanished. Ayane instead suggests they look around other places in Kumon-mi first, citing the small possibility that other people were trapped as they were last night. While he finds this unlikely, he obliges. Unfortunately, there is no one in town no matter where they go, and after a stop at Koi Cafe they admit the idea was ridiculous. As Sensei gets ready to head to the dorms, Ayane hesitates, revealing that the \"voices\" she mentioned hearing last night have repeatedly warned her not to go there yet. He reminds her of her assertion that these voices are nonsense and continues the walk regardless. The outside of the dorms is empty; Sensei assures himself that Maya will be inside. Upon entering her room and finding nothing, though, he loses hope completely, admitting aloud that Maya's gone. Having sensed he'd break down like this, Ayane immediately tries to calm him down, but he snaps at her, asking if it's wrong for him to freak out when he might never see Maya again. She tells him it is, and that he'll need to fight since he's still trapped in his house. Sensei snaps back to his safety room while embracing Sana , but only for a moment, as he soon \"wakes up\" for real and finds himself atop the roof with Maya in his arms. He wonders if he'll be reset soon, but Maya assures him that he'll be fine since she's the one being reset as they speak, feeling her memories beginning to fade away and having lost all concept of time until Sensei found her. With no way to prevent the inevitable, he decides to fulfill Maya's last request to let her be wiped on a slightly happier note and does his best to enjoy their remaining time together, promising to fix her memories once the world resets no matter how long it takes . Calling Sensei by his true name , Maya confesses her undying love for him before disappearing completely.",
