        "synopsis": "Ami , Ayane and Karin are watching Tsuneyo standing waist-deep inside the ocean, being seemingly unfazed by the cold. The girls are unsure if she’ll be fine until Ayane thinks they should join her, but their attempts to make Tsuneyo explain how cold the water is fails due to her not understanding what they want. While Tsuneyo berates them for their cowardice, Noodles arrives at the beach and lands on her shoulder, much to her joy, while the three girls on the beach are surprised that the bird managed to follow them. Under a gazebo behind them, Rin tries to psyche herself up for her confession, but has massive doubts about it’s success. Futaba tries to encourage her by reminding her that she has some experience now , reminds her that she is closer to Otoha than she was with Chika at the time and recommends that she should prepare a reaction for every possible outcome. Rin is surprised by Futaba’s wisdom regarding romance and appreciates her support. Futaba reminds her that Sensei will also be there to support her if her confession backfires again, which Rin is already knows since she gave him a heads-up and is ready to spend another night crying her eyes out in his presence . Meanwhile, Miku and Sana are sitting a bit further away and are observing their swimming classmates. Miku tells her what happened during their meeting before noticing that Sana looks a bit off, but she claims it’s just tiredness. Miku wants her to trust her a bit more, especially because both know each other since middle school, and both bond over being some of the shortest girls in class and plan to play games together. Their conversation continues, but once Sensei comes up as at topic, their expression and mood get darker when Miku mentions her previous visit and remembers her night there . After a long pause, Sana asks Miku how she feels about Sensei. She wants him to be with Makoto , but when Sana wants him to be with no one, she admits that she would accept this outcome too.",
