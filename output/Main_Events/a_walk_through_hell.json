Ayane tries again to make everyone aware of the time loop, but Sensei tells her that everyone will see the truth once they’re on the rooftop after he prepared everyone for it , much to Maya ’s annoyance. With that out of the way, Ayane and Uta announce the contests, but remind them that the competitions and time schedules for the second day are still incomplete.",
