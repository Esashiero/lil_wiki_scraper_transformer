        "synopsis": "Sensei meets Chika and Yumi . Chika gets annoyed at how Sensei and Yumi aren't getting along, and despite both of them saying it isn't a good idea, insists that the two of them have dinner together and at least try to get along. She takes them to Tojo Ramen , which Sensei and Yumi both think looks a bit sketchy. Chika quietly tells Sensei that Yumi \"only gets this angry when she's feeling vulnerable\", so he should try to be nice. Inside, Yumi reveals that she didn't get the job , and also talks about Sensei's comment about self-control . She says that she just \"isn't meant\" to be like everyone else, calls her self \"everything horrible\", and leaves. Shortly afterwards, a woman whom Sensei doesn't know sits down and asks what happened. They talk about kids â€” she has one, but doesn't know where she is, and recommends against ever having kids himself. She gets him to pay for their ramen.",
