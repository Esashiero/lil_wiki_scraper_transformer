        "synopsis": "Sensei and Nodoka make their way to the park in the outer-barrier, and while Rin wanted to accompany them, she forgot that she had a doctor's appointment. After some small talk about the cold weather, Nodoka points out how what he's going to do looks rather suspicious, with Sensei agreeing it does when she phrases it in a way that makes it look not normal. She thinks things shouldn't be normal, because it's the only way to create unique and exciting interactions, like how him having to convince Otoha to join his class will be a special event between them. Sensei points out how she can make anything sound special if she phrases it right, and Nodoka reminds him that this is what artists like Otoha and her do. She also tells him how most people decide to praise others for the work they do instead of trying to create something and getting praised themselves. Sensei assume she's one of those creatives who pretend to be bad to avoid getting praised, but Nodoka isn't really sure what she is, though assumes she's some kind of observer of human interactions. Nodoka awards Sensei five Nodoka points during this interaction, but he's unsatisfied with the amount he gets after hearing how valuable five points actually are. Sensei brings the topic back to Otoha, and Nodoka tells him that she will be predictable, and while Sensei thinks that Nodoka will be too after some time, she isn't sure if it will be that easy for him to understand her, though she's looking forward to finally meet someone who actually manages to achieve this. After some more banter, both reach the park. They approach Otoha, and Nodoka gets the conversation going in her usual manner before letting Sensei handle the rest by himself. After Sensei uses her mentioning her friendship with Rin to break the ice, Otoha cuts to the chase and asks if their visit is about her transfer, based on the fact that both her friends tried in vain to convince her. She's still hesitant to accept it due to her being bad with change and wanting to keep her freedom. Sensei doesn't feel like she has any freedom considering how her freedom depends on her academic performance, but when Otoha states her belief that students should prioritize their grades over their freedom, he uses the moment and tells her that she can do whatever she wants if she joins his class. Otoha is confused on what he means with this, and Sensei explains how he runs his class and offers her a place in it, especially with Nodoka, Rin and Noriko wanting her there as well. While hearing this makes the transfer more appealing, she's still too scared to go through with it, not sure if it's worth to convince her parents to allow her transfer and being placed in a dorm when the offer still sounds too good for her. After being asked by Otoha about the stability of her grades, Nodoka points out how she already wants to leave her suffocating home life and encourages her to leave her metaphorical cage and spread her broken wings. When Nodoka mentions a possible relationship with Rin, Otoha finally agrees, mostly to shut her up, and thinks that she will be successful in convincing her parents if Sensei keeps his word about her grades, which he will. Otoha leaves shortly after, needing to be at home soon and wanting to get away from Sensei and Nodoka's weird chemistry.",
