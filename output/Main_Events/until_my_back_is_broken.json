        "synopsis": "Sensei lets out a sigh as he tries to accept the encroaching exhaustion the Dorm Wars will bring. Imani quickly notices his premature annoyance and asks if he's finally grown tired of being the constant center of attention – He's unable to give a straight answer, and Imani tells him to focus on the upcoming events and ensuring the girls all have fun. She leaves to give Wakana a call, advising Sensei to keep safe as it's only a matter of time before the hugging contest starts. Before he's able to be alone for long, he receives a call from Niki , who quickly notices his sour mood and agrees to come to see him later tonight. The call ends and Sensei thinks to himself how nice it is to have something to look forward to, especially something he can't be judged for – But it's undercut by the feeling he has more people he should be spending time with, wondering how he can be with all of them and how he can be himself when he’s incomplete. He opts to ignore it as he always does. Off to the side, Noriko approaches Maya , faux-mocking her to start a conversation. Maya becomes immediately furious with Noriko for speaking to her at all and tries to push her away, but it doesn’t work and Noriko’s willingness to play along with her threat to rip her tongue out creeps her out. Meanwhile, Tsuneyo and Yumi start sizing each other up, with Yumi swearing that a fight between them will end differently than last time . Tsuneyo meanwhile sees herself as the superior fighter and more committed to help her friends claim the prize, which is why she doesn’t think she will lose. The tension continues to build between both sets of girls, boiling over once Makoto and Uta finally signal the start of the contest. Immediately, Tsuneyo tackles Yumi to the ground, leaving Noriko an opportunity to steal a hug. Maya chases after, calling out to Ami to play defense, who quickly cuts Noriko off and chases her away. The beach now in chaos, Makoto, Miku , Uta, and Io approach Sensei, and Uta asks how he intends to spend his morning. When he decides to wait for someone to make that decision for him, Makoto ends up being the one to do so, whisking him away as the others look away in disappointment.",
