        "synopsis": "After Sensei finds out Yumi doesn't care about his presence when considering when and how to bully other people, he calls Yumi into his office to address her behavior, only to figure out she's not coming at all after more than thirty minutes have passed since the end of the final school bell, and Futaba knocks on the door instead. Sensei grants her permission to enter. Futaba immediately apologizes for the intrusion, but Sensei emphatically dismisses it as no concern since he now knows Yumi won't be coming, as Futaba had seen her leave the grounds. Futaba expresses concern over Yumi's continued actions, a sentiment which Sensei shares, not only concerned for Futaba's well-being, but secretly wondering how Yumi turned out to be the way she is. Futaba is shocked when Sensei begins dismissing Yumi as an immediate concern with abrasive language, but Sensei says to make nothing of it since the same treatment is what he's been receiving from Yumi since the very beginning, and he comments his concern of thinking the only way she'll learn is the hard way. Futaba begins to divulge to Sensei that she's not comfortable with her body, and wishes the other girls wouldn't have to jump to her defense so often, and Sensei begins to have an internal debate when he realizes that he isn't sure what he can say to assuage Futaba's concerns. Eventually, he decides to bulldoze the wall down, and gives Futaba a compliment about her appearance. She has difficulty accepting it, so he repeats himself, and explains that the implications don't matter, as opposed to helping Futaba become more self-confident. The two converse for a brief moment longer, but Futaba leaves the office, flustered, after Sensei makes a joke about offering in-house counseling and charging for certain services. His duties complete, Sensei also leaves the school to go about his evening.",
