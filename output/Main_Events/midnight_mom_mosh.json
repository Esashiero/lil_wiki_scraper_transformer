        "synopsis": "Sensei wanders around outside after handing Ayane a list filled with every name she wanted him to write down. He contemplates about the fact that he technically didn’t betray anyone, yet still feels conflicted about what he did. He makes his way back home after receiving a call from Ami , who reminds him that he’s late for the next contest there. Back home, he isn’t in the mood to enjoy the contest, knowing that he severely hurt Ayane’s feelings and regretting that he didn’t mark less names on the list and let her live in ignorance. His mood changes instantly, though and he’s ready to judge the contest for the sake of everyone else. Ami complains that there are too many women inside their house and Sensei mentioning that he still has Io ’s game from her last visit and bringing up his karaoke experience with Uta doesn’t help. She decides to have a private talk with both of them and Sensei begs her not to stain the floor as he makes his way to the participants and their daughters. After some smalltalk with the Tsukioka’s and the Miyamura’s, Imani wants them to start the first round since it’s late and everyone probably wants to go to bed soon. With the contest ending in a tie and no time left for another task, Sensei is forced to name a winner instead. After declaring one of them the winner, Sensei decides to go to bed while everyone else leaves his house, but Ami prohibits him from sleeping at home when she’s at the hotel and demands that he comes with them. Realizing that he can’t argue against her, he begrudgingly follows them.",
