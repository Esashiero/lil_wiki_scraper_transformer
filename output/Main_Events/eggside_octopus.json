        "synopsis": "Something speaks to Sensei as he sleeps. While at first, its speech is nigh incomprehensible, it soon wishes him a Happy Halloween, telling him it hopes the mess of tonight will be easily swept up. It warns him that it'll be watching carefully tonight, for otherwise it would go blind, and the world would go dark as a result â€“ And while he might not mind such a life for himself , he wouldn't accept the same hurt being put on everyone else. Something knocks on Sensei's bedroom door, and he awakens to find Maya crouched down next to him. He's comforted by her presence, though still unused to seeing her smile so freely. As he continues to talk to her, specifically about all that's happened between them as of late , Maya becomes increasingly confused and worried, trying to leave and let Sensei get more sleep. When he insists she stays, and Maya tells him that she's \"not who he thinks she is\". Sensei fully wakes up and realizes the person he's been talking to is Ami , albeit in Maya's clothes. While he dismisses what he was saying as \"dreamspeak\", Ami still insists they skip tonight's Halloween Party and rest instead. Sensei refuses, immediately jumping out of bed and rushing into the living room. Sensei enters the living room with Ami, only to find Ayane who is also inexplicably dressed up as Maya. After a few impressions, the two reveal that they'll be dressing up as Maya tonight as both a bit of fun and as payback for Maya's first Halloween costume . On cue, Maya opens the front door, immediately annoyed upon seeing Ami and Ayane. This is exacerbated as both girls begin impersonating her once again, causing Maya to angrily demand they stop and put on their \"real costumes\". They both reveal that these are their \"real costumes\", while Ami subtly tries to pry out information about Sensei's \"dreamspeak\". Maya's taken aback by this sudden change in topic but drops the topic when Ami pretends she didn't say anything. Getting ready to leave, Ami steps away to grab her phone while Maya and Ayane express concern for Sensei, who's been unusually quiet all morning. He snaps out of his thoughts and insists he's fine, adding that he has been feeling weird since he woke up. Ayane expresses a similar sentiment, though Maya seems completely fine. Dropping this tangent, the two fill Sensei in on more details regarding tonight's proposed after-party , during which Maya reveals she'll be attempting to enjoy herself more thoroughly tonight rather than focus on details relating to resets. Ayane pokes fun at this sudden change in character as Ami returns to the group. The four of them begin the trip to Ayane's place once Sensei finishes getting dressed.",
