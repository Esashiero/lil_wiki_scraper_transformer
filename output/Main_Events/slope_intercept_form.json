Makoto is frustrated by Ami's complaints and lack of retention, and the two quickly start arguing amongst one another, until Makoto and Ami both turn to Sensei at the same time and ask him the question they were arguing about. After he makes his choice, the two quickly return to arguing, before Makoto decides it's probably better if everyone takes a break to cool off. The two try to take about their interests, but when Makoto answers that Sensei is one of hers, the conversation quickly died, and shortly after, everyone departs, and Sensei leaves to go about his evening.",
