        "synopsis": "After classes have finished for the day, Sensei is on his way back to the classroom from a trip to the teachers' lounge, where Makoto is waiting to speak to him. He wonders whether she will begin questioning his teaching 'methods' again, but brushes it off and enters the classroom. He finds Makoto facing away from him, psyching herself up for what seems to be a confession of some kind, and questioning her own resolve. She begins to make comments that are less than savory, and Sensei makes his presence known to stop Makoto from saying something she'll regret. After the first attempt fails due to Makoto thinking she's hearing his voice in her head, he decides to be a smartass to show he's actually behind her. She turns around and asks how much he heard, and is disconcerted to hear he heard mostly everything. She quickly denies the situation being a confession, and starts talking about Sensei's shoulder massage , and asks Sensei to not touch her again. He agrees, but points out that her having interest in it might complicate that decision, only for her to start borderline shouting out of anxiety, which Sensei has to put a quick stop to, lest someone outside the classroom hear her. However, Makoto does , in fact, end up giving Sensei a confession - which he reaffirms by pointing out the multiple times that her saying it's not will only make it seem more like one - where she tells him she doesn't want to always worry about studying, and instead have relaxing days too, where she can feel happy with the day's events. She confides in him that she wants to see him more often outside of school, something which Sensei easily accepts, before they finish cleaning the classroom and leave the school to go about their evening.",
