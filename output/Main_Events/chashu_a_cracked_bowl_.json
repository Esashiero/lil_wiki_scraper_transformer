        "synopsis": "Wakana and Osako celebrate Christmas by taking a walk. They have a conversation about the beauty of Christmas lights and Wakana’s compulsive nature, which Osako finds exciting at times but also terrifying in a horrible and tolerable way . Wakana apologizes again, confesses that she wants many more Christmases with her and that she hopes that her mistakes won’t get in the way of that. Osako reminds her that her last mistake almost ended in her death and she hopes that she understands why she’s still concerned about her. She thinks that she’s more clingy than concerned but doesn’t mind. Osako has no idea how she can protect her from herself, but Wakana tells her that she has to overcome this problem on her own and that she only needs to stay with her or trust her when she can’t be physically by her side. They decide to leave once Wakana gets tired of staring at Christmas lights and Wakana holds Osako’s arm since she doesn’t want her to worry about losing her in the crowd. Tsuneyo continues her monologue about chashu bowls by stating that you can’t only check its content for bumps and grooves, but also have to check the bowl for cracks and hope they don’t get worse, using it as a metaphor for looking at the bigger picture. At the same time in Sara ’s bar, Maki tries to give Kaori advice how to strike a cock after she mentioned her pet rooster. Yuki wants her to work and help her find the corkscrew while Sara is happy that her business is finally getting back on track and complains to Haruka for mocking her. Yuki suddenly remembers that Christmas Eve is also Kaori’s birthday and the girls decide to celebrate it with her.",
