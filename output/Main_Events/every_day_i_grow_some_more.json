        "synopsis": "The event begins with a mysterious narrator talking to the game protagonist in the dark. They tell him about the things they'll never understand, the first one being how dust particles glow in the light and how the invisible can be made seen , and the second of those things being the romanticization of death. Then, as the third and last thing they says it's you, the protagonist of the game. He's described as being trapped in darkness, somewhere between life and death, with eyes swollen shut. The narrator admits they've taken the liberty of illuminating some dust for the protagonist, but he is not able to see that and admits it would be nice to have him just as confused as them, for it is lonely out there. The protagonist is asked if he likes poetry but does not answer, and so the narrator admits to not being a big fan of it due to the interpretation needed to read those and all the contraditory meanings you can find within them. However a famous quote from Edgar Allan Poe is cited as one the narrator likes, “ There is no beauty without some strangeness in it's proportions ”, and that the protagonist will soon enjoy it too. It is revealed to him he's going somewhere special with strange proportions and that he'll come to learn in due time about the beauty life has to offer even in the darkest moments. The narrator tells him they love him, although not romantically, but for simply being here with them. Then the narrator craves firmly that the protagonist will come to hate him in due time and that he hopes they are able to meet one day. Under a clear blue sky, allegedly missing the sunlight, the narrator implies the weather will be like this for quite some time. They reveal to the protagonist that nothing is real ,  not even the people he will meet or himself for that matter, whether he'd like to believe this or not — something a normal teenage girl will remind him very often . The narrator refers to everything as air and asks him to breathe with them to envelop himself in happier days. and reveals this world was made for him. The narrator dearly wishes for the protagonist to have fun and says that they'll be right there whenever needed if he closes his eyes. Then, they urge him to jump. When he decides to do so, the mysterious protagonist is awakened in a classroom, by an unknown redhead teenage girl with pigtails . The protagonist is not able to recognize the place he's in or the girl in front of him. Not recalling his first or last name either, he decides to stick with what the redhead seems to call him: Sensei . The classroom he finds himself in has a sense of familiarity but he still cannot remember anything. The girl grows progressively worried as he is not able to remember her name either or the fact that the two of them live together. She then reveals herself to be Ami Arakawa , his student and niece. As Ami decides to guide him back home, it becomes clear how some of Sensei's thoughts seems rather dark.",
