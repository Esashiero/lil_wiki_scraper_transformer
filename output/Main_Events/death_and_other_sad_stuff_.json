        "synopsis": "In the other half of town, away from the chaos and noise of the class Christmas Party , the Chosokabe sisters and Yumi can be found in the Chosokabe Flat , celebrating Christmas on their own. While Chinami unwraps some of her Christmas presents, Chika rants to Yumi atop her bed about how pointless the class Christmas party is without Sensei around as an incentive to attend. The rant begins to spiral out of control as Chika becomes increasingly wound up attempting to rationalize his disappearance, leading Yumi to outright ask how stable she currently feels. Chika's response only creates further concern, both girls agreeing her obsessive behavior isn't healthy but having no idea how to stop it. Yumi reassures Chika that Sensei is unlikely to disappear forever, suggesting he simply needs time to reset himself mentally similar to her . This does little to calm Chika down and her paranoid suggestions only continue down an increasingly self-deprecating path, wondering if the whole situation is merely another manifestation of her life's bad luck. Out of ideas, Yumi decides to be completely honest, criticizing her friend for getting herself into this situation while admitting that neither of them can be certain just how this situation will end. Chika remains pessimistic, having heard about a similar story from Noriko and anticipating him to abandon everyone like back then. Due to Sensei disappearing with her during Halloween, along with her strangely clingy behavior , Chika's all but convinced Ami's behind his disappearance. Yumi doesn't buy the theory, especially when she remembers Sensei showing up to class the day after Chika claims he \"disappeared\". Unable to remember this detail though, Yumi instead casts suspicion on Maya and Ayane , recalling the two's close relationship with Ami, and Chika also remembers them and Sana leaving with him. While Chika thinks Ayane is a collaborator, though she can't say if it's due to blackmail or her own volition, she doesn't believe Maya and Sana are \"in\" on the situation, feeling the two aren't close enough to Sensei to help with Ami's scheme. She asserts her conviction and swears to hurt Ami if she's done the same to Sensei, ready to accept expulsion. Yumi dismisses this as empty words, pointing out how much disruption being expelled would cause. Chika disagrees, feeling expulsion will hinder her little as her chances at a great future are already so low â€“ Raising Chinami occupies so much time, keeping both girls from reaching for grander success. Instead, the two of them have to settle for much humbler futures, ones which are still achievable as evidenced by the success Chika's career shift has brought. Yumi agrees with all of these points but argues that Chika shouldn't be comfortable squandering the opportunity just to satiate anger or anxiety. After rejecting the idea of calling in a wellness check, Yumi suggests to her that she write a card for him. This idea, while somewhat cheesy, is sure to at least stir some emotion, even in someone as stoic and cynical as Sensei. Chika wonders how she could get one to him without having to go through Ami, but Yumi can't give her an answer and also has to leave to attend a \"thing\", with Chika assuming she's going to the Christmas party. Before she goes, she learns that Chika has a present for them that will improve their living conditions, but it will take some time until it's ready.",
