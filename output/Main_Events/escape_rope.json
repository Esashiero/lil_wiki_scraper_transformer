        "synopsis": "Sensei returns to Molly , who’s completely drunk. He wonders how she’s still conscious, because she’s barely able to hold a coherent conversation, but is relieved to see she didn’t invite Kirin to join her. He wants to know how she managed to get alcohol, considering that everyone tried to prevent this after her getting drunk during the last party , and she tells him she got it from the same storage and no one bothers to stop her, including Futaba who joined her arch nemesis . She starts complaining about her dating Otoha , and Sensei is glad to see that, while she’s still complaining about someone, she’s at least still standing. When Sensei tries to talk with her again, he starts to “black out” and what he wants to say is replaced by something else. When he snaps out of it, Molly is still complaining about Rin’s relationship, and Sensei tries to reason with her, but ends up making her more mad, even calling him out for not trying to understand her. He decides to be responsible for once and confiscate her beer, but, after a quick “blackout”, he instead wants to talk more about Rin’s relationship, as Molly starts to regret coming to the party, feeling like everyone abandoned her. After making countless references he doesn’t get, Sensei tries to cheer her up but can only offer him standing with her, which manages to clam her down a little. She starts to get sad due to Rin, but Sensei thinks she should stay away from her since she got hurt the last time she wanted to speak with her , making her wonder if Otoha knows about this already or if Rin decides to hide it until she can’t anymore. Sensei points out that she did the same in regards to her feelings , wanting to compare her to Rin, but ends up making her cry. When he tries to calm her down, she thinks he’s on Rin’s side, and when he tries to reason with her so things don’t take a bad turn, she finally gets fed up with him and decides to leave, entering one of the hallways. Sensei’s conflicted on what he should do, until Uta appears and tells him to follow her and make up for making her cry. He’s surprised to see her since she’s supposed to play truth or dare , and she admits that they still are, but she doesn’t care right now after she and her group saw his and Molly’s argument. After a bit of convincing, Sensei follows Molly into the hallway.",
