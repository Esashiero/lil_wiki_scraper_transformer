Rin and Otoha join them and explain the contest to him and Haruka â€“ Sensei has to spend time with both contestants until one of them starts flirting back or their roommates spot any sign of them showing interest in him. Between his students being adorable across the board and them fighting for him, Haruka feels like he lucked out with his class, and while he agrees with this in general, he can't agree with her at the moment when the current contest entails him being rejected over and over again. After a quick talk with the Miyamura's about Miku 's victory , the contest begins. While the contest is going on, the following interactions take place: After informing Makoto about the result, Sensei and the girls make their way to the library.",
