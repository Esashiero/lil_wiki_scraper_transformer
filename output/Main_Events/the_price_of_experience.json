        "synopsis": "Sensei receives a text message from Ami and, due to it’s vagueness, calls her immediately. He learns that she’s at his house with some friends, which reminds him that there was a slumber party today, and she asks him if he can buy some snacks on his way back, hanging up before he can answer. While he makes his way to a convenience store, he can’t buy anything since he’s broke. He returns home and tells everyone who’s there – Ami, Sana , Molly and Tsuneyo - the bad news. He’s surprised to see that only four of them are here, but the girls explain that the other members of the manga club had plans and Ayane wasn’t feeling well, despite her promising that she would stop doing this . After a discussion about video games, Ami requests that Sensei cooks them dinner to make up for failing to bring them snacks, but since he never cooked before, Tsuneyo volunteers to prepare something instead. He accompanies her to show where they store everything. While he watches her, he notices how impressive Tsuneyo is. While Tsuneyo looks over the ingredients she has available, they start to talk about her father and how Sensei thinks that he was imprisoning her, while she sees his actions as signs affection, believing that being locked away forever in exchange for staying alive is a fair trade. She tries to make him understand her point of view by asking if he would lock up Ami forever if it would keep her alive, but Sensei doesn’t have an answer. Tsuneyo admits that she would’ve accepted this fate, but is still glad that she got the opportunity to leave. Both share a moment of silence until Sensei receives a phone call from Ayane.",
