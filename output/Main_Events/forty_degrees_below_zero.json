        "synopsis": "While on his way home, Sensei finds Karin sitting on a bench and being seemingly lost in thoughts. He approaches her and directs his attention to the bags she's carrying. Karin explains that Kirin and she were supposed to hang up fliers to advertise the soccer club, but Kirin hasn't come yet, probably because she's still mad at her for what happened the previous week . Sensei assumed she already apologized for her behavior, but Karin thinks he should've learned enough about Kirin to know that this was never going to happen. Sensei reminds her that they have spend little time together since their first meeting and how difficult it is to figure Kirin out, something Karin knows all to well, but points out how Kirin transferring into his class will give him enough time to learn more about her. She also confirms that Kirin asked to be transferred instead of being transferred for causing trouble, though Sensei already knew that due to her letting it slip after Karin left. Karin herself didn't learn it from her, but she had a hunch, because both have shared a room for a long time and, therefore, understands her pretty well. Seha lso warns Sensei to not believe Kirin when she claims that Karin still talks in her sleep, since she stopped doing this after learning and getting embarrassed about it a couple years ago. Sensei jokingly states that he'll add this information to her entry in his diary, which causes her nervousness to act up, something Sensei finds weird given that both have already eaten out together with little issues after she gave him her homemade cookies. Karin is surprised to hear that he actually ate them, but is so happy to hear how good they were that she wants to make another batch for him, but ends up too excited again and falls back into embarrassed silence. Karin wonders how Kirin can talk to him so easily. Apparently, she becomes very outgoing and active whenever she's around him, which is a stark contrast to the passive recluse she sees at home. She wishes she could be as confident in Sensei's presence as her sister is instead of having to fight her insecurities and nervousness every time. As she gets lost in her own elaborate fantasies, Sensei calls her back to reality and wants to know how long she has been waiting for Kirin, which turns out to be two hours. Sensei wonders why she waited this long in the cold for her, and Karin informs him that she gave up on Kirin after a while and waited for Sensei instead, because she needs to talk to him about something and she was so afraid of missing him that she didn't attempt to go to his office. Karin wants to know how close he and her sister already are, partly because she wants to know where her change of personality comes from and if she's safe in Sensei's company, and partly for reasons she can't say out loud, though Sensei can tell that Karin wants to get closer to him as well. Sensei knows there are only to answers he can give and which one he picks determines how things will play out from here:",
