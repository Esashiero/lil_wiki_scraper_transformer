        "synopsis": "A narrator speaks, but to whom is unclear. They comment how something's in the air tonight, but find it difficult to parse. Instead, they admit they did something bad and how they started to take some liberties with the rules they were given. They insist this is for the betterment of the world, but admit \"better\" and \"worse\" are subjective terms that aren't mutually exclusive. Their resolve is strong nonetheless, but it's inevitable something \"bigger\" will swallow them whole. They find this fitting, as they still don't exist, being the light of the moon and the shadow that follows, always following someone. Appearing from the brush of trees is Ayane , who's finally managed to return from her contest , sporting a new daisy pin in her hair. She confidently declares her feelings aloud, drawing the immediate attention of Maya , Ami , and Sensei , who all rush to her side. Maya tries to pry out details about her prolonged absence and her improved mood, but Ayane answers ambiguously, insisting she was taking a vacation. Then with Ami, Ayane asks if the two of them can speak for a bit later tonight, throwing a bit of venom towards Ami for being the one who led her so deep into the forest, ignoring her claim that she left her where she was supposed to. Finally, Maya asks Sensei for his opinion on Ayanesâ€™s return, who calmly admits he was slightly worried but had faith she'd return. The remaining girls sit around the campfire, ready to begin the Dorm Wars' last contest, the scary story contest. After a bit of talking, Uta hands the stage over to Futaba and Nodoka , who recite their stories. While Futaba's is fairly normal and earns unanimous praise, sans Yasu , Nodoka abandons her horror story and wants to tell them a different story instead, which comes across as a nonsensical, seemingly aimlessly rant, telling a story of a flower frozen in time, of three moons, and of love. The story is abruptly ended when Sensei demands Nodoka come to see him.",
