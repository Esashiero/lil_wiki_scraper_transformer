        "synopsis": "Once he returns to the lobby, Sensei finds Noriko holding a box. He assumes this is the present she talked about and that it’s something with sentimental value. Noriko knows that he gave a present to Miku and asks if she liked it. He tells her that she did and didn’t and shifts the conversation back to the box, wanting to know if he can open it. She tells him to follow her to somewhere more private first since she knows she’s going to cry and doesn’t want to be seen like that. He thinks she knows about the boiler room , but she doesn’t and, since it involves Kirin , doesn’t want to know, so she suggests the rooftop instead. As they reach the rooftop, Sensei wonders how many more girls he'll have to see cry and, after stopping Noriko from stalling, opens the box. Inside are an assortment of letters Niki wrote to him following his disappearance eight years ago. While he reads them, Noriko tells him she found them inside Niki's closet recently, and how reading them made her realize how outmatched she is in the fight for his heart. Despite knowing it'll ruin her chances, she brought him these letters, and promises to bring more fragments of their past, so she can help him remember it. He finishes reading as Noriko starts crying. She is aware that he could write them off as fakes, but hopes he'll keep their feelings in mind. Sensei stares blankly at the last letter, ignoring Noriko's attempts to get his attention. As she calls his name, he \"blacks out\". Upon completion of a \"survey\", a care package is sent, and with it, a memory from Sensei's pasts. He finds himself in Niki’s childhood bedroom with a younger version of her and himself spending Christmas together by watching an anime. The two lay next to each other, with the younger Sensei teasing Niki about her flushed face as she tries to hide it behind the excuse of it being too hot. When his younger self offers to turn the heat down, he meets eyes with his older self. Sensei breaks out of his stasis as Noriko whispers in his ear. She reaffirms her love for him and how, even if she's stuck in \"second place\", it at least always gives her a goal to work towards. He tells her how he remembered something and she hopes it was a nice memory. Sensei’s phone rings and Noriko recommends him to answers as she makes her exit. He vividly recalls the memory he saw, but has no idea why he saw this specific one. He gets a second message and finally decides to look who’s texting him. Opening his phone, he sees it's Niki, who demands he come to the lobby immediately.",
