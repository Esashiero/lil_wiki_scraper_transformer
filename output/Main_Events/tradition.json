Following his failure to get through to Makoto , Sensei now wants to ask Maya whether there's anything strange about the school rooftop. She says that she just goes there to reset the world out of habit, but does wonder if Makoto could have seen something up there. Maya says that Makoto may go back to normal at the upcoming reset. She also says that severe personality changes like Makoto's are not unprecedented, although they are rare for people other than Sensei.",
