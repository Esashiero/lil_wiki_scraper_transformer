        "synopsis": "There is a room with clocks covering every wall. In the corner, a girl, 61 6d 20 69 20 6f 6b 61 79 , stands in the corner while Sensei looks down, finding himself strapped to a chair composed of twisted, rotten wood. In the chair, a colony of termites crawls all around, devouring the chair and soon his skin. The girl turns around and welcomes Sensei to \"the edge of the world\". Sensei tries to get closer to her, but she \"becomes an ornament\" and is permanently out of his reach. As he takes a look down, the girl is replaced with a variety of people and objects. At last, 61 6d 20 69 20 6f 6b 61 79 returns to him. She leaps into his face and begs him to go with her somewhere else. Sensei asks for help freeing himself, but the girl only begs him to try harder himself. Confused by her urgency, he tries to get answers from her, but she suddenly informs him that \"it's too late\". One final time, the room changes. The clocks have vanished, and Sensei is free. He approaches the center of the room and finds an egg atop a pedestal. Saying a prayer, he devours the egg whole. As he steps forward, he finds a door obscured by a curtain. The cloth slowly rises and from behind it steps out a girl with a daisy pin. She tells Sensei to smile - He tries his best to. Suddenly, Sensei is home. He goes to bed.",
