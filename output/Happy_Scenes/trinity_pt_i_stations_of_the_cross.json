        "synopsis": "The dorms are upside down. Sensei calls Ami out to him, and Maya is there too. They're going to take him on a tour. Eventually, the room fills up with wonderful things. Ami asks if he loves her, and tries to touch him, but she can't move her arms. Sensei sympathizes, since has often felt suffocated by the world around me, and sometimes even feels like he's strapped to a chair. Ami says that she can see the way he feels about everything and everyone, and it's scary. She'd do anything for him, but only God can rewrite the world, and since Sensei doesn't believe in God, Ami can't have a world where she is included among the wonderful things cuddled up beside him. She dissolves. Maya (a version with normal eyes) asks him why he is in the dorms at 3 AM. She was going for a walk, and says that he should probably just come with her. They arrive at a tree, illuminated by three spotlights. There is a cat. They are near an abandoned school building, although Maya says that it's \"many other things as well\". She talks about the religious concept of there simultaneously being \"three gods, but also only one god\". Maya thinks that any number of gods is too many, and wishes \"they’d all just go away\". She then tells him that God is dead, so they'll never have to worry about three all at once, but if he ever has to choose, she hopes that he'll choose the \"least callous of them\". An error occurs — God is not dead after all.",
