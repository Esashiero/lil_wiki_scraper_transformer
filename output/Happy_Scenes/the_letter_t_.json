        "synopsis": "Trying to return home, Sensei somehow finds himself in a place he's never seen before. In the distance ahead of him, he can faintly make out a \"giant letter T\" being illuminated by several spotlights. He reminds himself of how much he hates the letter T before stepping closer. As he reaches \"the T\", it begins to snow, and the voice of a young girl calls out to him. Looking up, he finds the girl, 61 6d 20 69 20 6f 6b 61 79, who has been nailed to the giant letter. She reminds him that \"something is buried beneath his feet\" and tells him to dig until his nail crack if he wants to find it. Sensei ignores this omen and tries to ask about the voice speaking to him through the music. \"Ami\" approaches from behind and reminds him that \"the end of the world will be beautiful\". She swoops around to face him, wearing her \"special outfit\", hoping to steal his attention away from the girl nailed above him. She's unsuccessful and reluctantly leaves Sensei with her, knowing that she will be \"dried out\" within a few minutes. Sensei approaches the girl once more, cleaning her feet - She speaks to him again, begging for water. Sensei tells her he doesn't have any, and that even if he did, she's too far up for him to reach. The girl meekly reminds him of the something beneath his feet, upsetting Sensei with \"looping\" dialogue. As he decides to head home, the girl begs him to help her, but Sensei refuses.",
