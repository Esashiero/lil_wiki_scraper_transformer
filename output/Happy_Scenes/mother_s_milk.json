        "synopsis": "Being pulled away from the TV Show he was on, Sensei is dragged into a strange place by a being taking the form of Ami . It tells him a story, a story of a spirit that, after living an eternity with no aspirations, suddenly found something it wanted - It wanted to want something. It tells him that he and that spirit are the same and that this is why he has found himself here. Reeling in confusion, Sensei asks the being who they are - It dryly proclaims itself to be him. It claims to be fear incarnate, one that changes with the angle of the light, a being that in wanting to be nothing has become everything. The being continues, mocking Sensei for his bloated sense of self-importance; For believing himself to be a protagonist while he \"walks with his eyes closed\". It asks him why he continues to play the game. Sensei meekly responds that he wants to learn, but isn't sure what he wants to learn quite yet, being too confused by his sudden transportation. The being remarks that Sensei is here because it is where he is meant to be, though his appearance is unwanted. The being finally introduces the place Sensei found himself in as \"The Wishing Well\", a place where the creators of mankind chronicle information about humanity for no other reason than their own interest. The specific portion of the Wishing Well the two of them are currently in is dubbed \"the library\". Only growing more and more confused with each passing second, Sensei tries to leave, not wanting to miss the reset . The being questions this motive, declaring his dedication to other people antithetical to his true purpose. Sensei demands to be let go, but the being commands his silence, telling him his role as a \"puppet\" is not yet done. It mocks him, asking if he'll struggle despite the futility - Sensei says he will. The being is pleased, excited to see what he will do next, but warns that what he's experienced so far pales in comparison to the things that have yet to come. It asks if he truly wishes to return home after learning this, which Sensei emphatically confirms, begging desperately to be let go. The being, revealing its name to be \"Nao\" (ä»Š), informs Sensei that it must first share with him the secrets it's kept stored in its \"bowels\". From here, Nao takes Sensei on a journey through his past. Specifically, his past with Sekai. Along the way, Sensei begs to not experience any more of the pain the memories bring. Nao reminds Sensei that he is broken beyond repair and that It hopes this trip has reminded him of this.",
