        "synopsis": "Instead of going to Tojo Ramen, Sensei goes \"somewhere fun\". Not His Telephone tells him that the only way to escape death is to accumulate as many affection points with girls as possible, since our GOD friend demands them as tribute. Sensei calls Maya in Spanish — she arrives and tells him how many layers of hell Hell there are, which he carves into his arm. Ami also arrives. They talk about offering up thanks to their God, who feeds off of happiness. Hope , whom Sensei has never seen before, observes that strange things happen to both of them in this horrible place. When Sensei asks \"hyl fvb tl\", Hope says of course not — rather, Hope is \"that which breaths\", and Sensei is the ground beneath. Hope wonders which NVK Sensei will JOVVZL, and whether Sensei might have been looking for someone with more wires. Then, Sensei is at the grave he visited , thinking about doing things to Ami and wondering if his lingering memories of her parents are real or planted. He thinks about how being in a place where only good things happen means that you don't have to take responsibility for anything you regret. There is only one god, and three gods, and also no gods. The three gods who exist will at least pretend to love us, so we should keep them alive by watering them and feeding them the bodies of our loved ones. But who are they? He is envious of clocks, and curses at the sky when it tells him that he will eventually be happy. After he passes out and dies, Sensei changes his mind and goes to Tojo Ramen after all.",
