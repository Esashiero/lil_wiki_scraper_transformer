        "synopsis": "While the world is broken , Sensei decides to visit the soccer field, where \"everything is normal\". He tries to find other people but discovers the field is empty aside from various discarded wigs. He initially goes around to each wig, collecting them for fun, before abruptly deciding he's bored and dropping them to the ground. As they hit the dirt, he realizes the wigs were disembodied heads, which suddenly sprout \"stubby flower stems\" and stare back at him. After selecting the head that resembles Miku , he approaches it, quickly discovering that it wasn't a head either but a watermelon. From behind him, Maya walks up, surprised to see him. She informs him that he's \"starting to disconnect\" and that if they want to get things \"back on track\", he'll have to follow her. Under the lure of cute girls, Maya lures him into the storage shed, and he suddenly finds himself somewhere completely different. As he's struggling to make sense of everything a girl named Saki walks in, who's looking for her friend. Sensei asks for help getting back to Kumon-Mi , but when she's unable to help, he heads back outside. He wakes up again - The world is still broken.",
