        "synopsis": "Sensei teleports back to his favorite room and talks to 61 6d 20 69 20 6f 6b 61 79 , who is trapped down there. It's a normal day at the bottom of everything. 61 asks if he wants to have sex, and he nails her to the wall. She urges him to make a new GODsdfghjwerghueqwhfwrfu HOPE with her, which can be taught to reset the world. She tells him to throw himself into the wishing well, where we can become everything we love. Nothing ever happens here, and he sits masturbating to \"any body that appears before me\" — this time, it was \"the body of a girl who died a long, long time ago\", whose name begins with the letter T. However, it's just a game. 61 says that everything is a metaphor, and that \"even these scarier parts of your mind that you’re only able to dig up when you’re at your most vulnerable are one and the same as those in the real world\" (if there is one). He decides that this world isn't a metaphor, because it's the only one he has. 61 reminds him that it was made just for him, and when he agrees, tells him that he is becoming more and more conscious with each passing minute — but has he learned to climb out yet?",
