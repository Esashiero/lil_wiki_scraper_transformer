She talks a bit about her relationship with Wakana, and says that she can't always predict what Wakana is going to do. She says that Wakana can feel \"weirdly distant\", and perhaps \"doesn't completely understand how other peoples' feelings work\". Osako admits to sometimes worrying that Wakana might change her mind about what she wants, although Sensei doesn't think that this is likely. Osako thanks Sensei for being a friend to Wakana, but also reminds him that if he tries anything, she knows lots of ways to kill him.",
