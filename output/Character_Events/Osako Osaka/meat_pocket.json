        "synopsis": "Sensei is helped up to his feet after Osako pummels him once more . Having now recovered from the pain, he's guided out of the Dojo and along the streets of Kumon-mi , unsure of where the two of them are headed. The two joke around a bit, but Sensei ends up dropping the act first, not wanting to stay out too long while Ami 's still recovering . Osako tells him they're going to grab something to eat, considering it an apology for beating him up earlier. The two soon walk into a nearby diner, a place Osako chose quickly on a whim so she wouldn't have to listen to more of Sensei's complaining. After briefly causing an incident with the staff, the two sit down with Osako ordering food for the both of them. Sensei's reluctant to eat it, feeling guilty for enjoying good food whilst Ami is forced to eat his subpar cooking. He decides instead to try and force Osako into venting her feelings right now, not wanting to interrupt his lunch with her self-loathing. She corrects him, saying today's discussion isn't about her specifically â€“ In fact, she's doing fine, something Sensei voices his envy of. This dynamic continues for a few minutes, with Osako trying to say something only for Sensei to interject and say something depressing. She eventually manages to break out of this loop, revealing to him that Wakana 's been absolutely obsessed with him and his period of isolation . For months now, Wakana has scoured over every piece of Ami's poetry that she could get hold of, trying to figure out what led to it. Osako had hoped this obsession would end once Sensei returned to society, but nothing's changed, and, left with no other ideas, she asks him to talk her down. Sensei confesses that he's already tried talking to her about this obsession, having assumed Wakana already dropped the issue. He apologizes for being unable to help, which Osako dismisses, admitting that her girlfriend has a habit of becoming hyper-fixated with things she can't understand. This obsession has only continued to get worse, with Wakana even accusing Ami of anticipating Sensei's recent tragedy . Osako finds this ridiculous considering how good his relationship is with his niece. Sensei clarifies the situation between him and Ami, correcting Osako by saying they're codependent on each other; The two of them have been there for each other ever since Ami's parents passed away, a tragedy which left Sensei an emotional wreck, requiring Ami to take care of him extensively. Now that it's her who's snapping, he's determined to make it up to her. He explains this as the reason he's still living, for if he were to end his life, she'd have no one to look after her anymore. From his perspective, giving in fully to his misery would only bring about her end as well, something Ami doesn't deserve just because she's mentally ill. He tries to end this rant by saying he'll talk to Wakana about not dissecting Ami's written feelings, but Osako cuts him off and asks if the feelings depicted in her poems are truly hers. Sensei's unsure whose feelings she could've written about, as he taught her to expressing her own feelings, but finds his words run dry and he's unable to remember ever teaching Ami. Osako suggests that Ami might be taking after her mother and all that she did, referring to her pseudonym by name. Sensei tells her to drop this topic immediately, asserting that no one can imitate her work or the way she viewed the world, that Ami must be taking after him and that he will leave if she continues to talk about her. Realizing that Wakana's theories might have some merit, she tries to ask Sensei what happened between him and Ami's mother. He leaves, with Osako calling after him and trying to assure him that she can't hurt him anymore. He tells her she still can.",
