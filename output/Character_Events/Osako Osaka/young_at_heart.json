        "synopsis": "After taking his seat and ordering his food, Sensei is disappointed to find Osako as his maid instead of Uta , who is currently swamped with customers due to the increasing foot traffic to the Maid Cafe . He's further disappointed when Osako refuses to humor him by playing into the usual maid personality , giving him a half-hearted \"Flavor Beam\" and refusing to call him \"Master\" out of disgust for him. Uta checks in on the two of them, asking Osako out for karaoke after work as Wakana is currently sick, leaving her schedule free. Sensei gets roped up in the plans as well, though suggests they leave Osako behind as she's \"too old\" to hang out with people as \"young\" as them. Osako eventually gives in to the idea as the other two continue to poke fun at her age, wanting to prove she's not as old as they're making her out to be. As Uta sings her first song, Osako and Sensei take a seat and begin to browse the song selections, finding nothing the two of them recognize. Osako admits she's never been to a karaoke bar before, having spent all her free time either practicing karate or on Wakana. While she had friends who would invite her out to things, she never really felt any incentive to participate, and when she began to date Wakana, she had virtually no friends at all. Sensei's not surprised to hear she was unpopular but asks if she thinks her current self is too centered around her girlfriend rather than her actual interests. Osako dismisses this concern, feeling that even if she is somewhat co-dependent, she's the happiest she's ever been in her life, and doesn't consider missing out on things like karaoke or hanging with friends as big deals - If she's content with the way things are, that's enough for her. Uta finishes her song and hands the mic to Osako, who manages to find a song she somewhat recognizes. Immediately, Sensei and Uta recoil at her singing, excusing themselves from the karaoke booth and running away before Osako can stop them.",
