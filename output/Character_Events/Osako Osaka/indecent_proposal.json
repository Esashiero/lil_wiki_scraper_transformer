        "synopsis": "After another day of school, Imani finds herself in Wakana 's office , the two working out further details for the school's upcoming Sports Day. Imani's initially confused as she looks at the plans on the clipboard, not understanding why the classes' are competing against themselves only. Wakana corrects this misunderstanding â€“ Only her class will be competing against themselves, while the rest of the school will go about the event as usual. Imani's confused as to why they're being singled out, with Wakana explaining that Class 1-A has become incredibly notorious among the other classes for being unruly and, due to their status as outcasts, none of the other students want to participate with them. Imani's initially not satisfied with this solution, as Ami still being absent would leave teams unbalanced, but Wakana asks her to find a solution for this without her help, because she already has to plan the rest of the Sports Day by herself. Imani considers using the Sports Day to give her class the opportunity to do another round of the Dorm Wars, and Wakana gives her blessing as long as they don't do anything like the swimsuit contest . Once she starts asking stupid questions, Imani starts to overstay her welcome and is forced to leave when Wakana threatens to call HR. Unbeknownst to her, though, Osako was discreetly hidden within the room, speaking up now that she and Wakana are alone. The two's conversation quickly turns sour as Osako's insecurities rear their head, prompting both to stand up and have a more proper discussion about this. Somewhat upset by this sudden burst of insecurity, Wakana tries to explain that she brought Osako to work with her in hopes of making up for how neglectful she's been as of late; She hadn't intended for this to lead to a discussion about perceived adequacy, so shifts the blame onto herself for being the cause of them. This doesn't make Osako feel better, who's become slowly convinced that the real cause of the tension in their relationship is because Wakana isn't as attracted to women as she previously thought. Wakana is somewhat offended by this accusation, and the situation becomes more and more tense as Osako suggests she should try a relationship with a man to see if she's more compatible with them. Hurt by her suggestion and the accusation that she's simply settled for Osako, Wakana sends her home, promising the two will talk in depth about this in the near future.",
