        "synopsis": "Sensei wakes up. A terrible start to the day, he wryly notes. As he starts to wake up, he reminisces on all that's changed since Ami 's fit of hysteria â€“ There's no longer the sweet scent of breakfast in the morning, and occasionally he's forced to clean up the place, though he can only do the bare minimum since he has no idea how to do most things, shown by the fact that he has no idea were Ami keeps most of their cleaning products. Additionally, Ami, while conscious enough to do certain things herself, still struggles to look at him, with her gaze completely focused on his cut hand in the brief periods she's not zoned out and staring at the ceiling. A phone call pulls him away from this train of thought and he's surprised to hear Osako on the other end. She reveals she'd stolen his number out of Wakana 's phone, wanting to check up on him after hearing he'd gone back to work. He faintly fills her in while she does the same, informing him that Ayane's begun attending the Dojo regularly again and is doing good now that he isn't there to distract her . He questions her treatment of someone clearly amid their depressive spiral, but ultimately drops it, especially once she asks him to meet her at the dojo. He's confused as to why she's attempting to do this behind Wakana's back and, upon confirming this incident won't also be about soup , agrees to show up in a couple of hours. Sensei rises from bed after taking a few minutes to summon the energy, getting ready to begin his new list of chores. He first detours into Ami's bedroom, finding her still asleep and hoping her dreams are as happy as his . As he goes to cook and clean, he's stricken with an immense amount of guilt, realizing that while he is at constant \"risk\" with all the girls attempting to rescue him, there won't be anyone coming to save Ami, even though she deserves to be saved way more than him. The day passes and Sensei arrives at the Dojo, unsure of Osako's intentions until she proceeds to beat him senseless as stress relief. As he lies on the floor, unable to catch his breath, he attempts to let death take him. Of course, he isn't actually near death, and Osako ignores his pleas to end him, so he's helped up and soon finds himself sitting side-to-side with his assailant. He glares at her with annoyance, joking that he's upset that she didn't finish the job before thanking her for helping him feel more alive. She's surprised to hear he's still suffering, having thought his prolonged absence would've helped him move on. He corrects her by telling her that he was unconscious for most of that time before adding that he doesn't want to talk about it. Osako, however, is determined to at least spend some time with him before talking about her problems. She warns him that moping around as he's currently doing won't make him feel better. This is fine with Sensei, as he doesn't want to feel better, seeing his misery as a form of retribution. Osako agrees that he probably deserves some sort of punishment for his reprehensible lifestyle, but that brooding and sulking will only worry everyone around him while making it harder to wake up in the morning, knowing this from her own insecurities. Sensei points out that there's a distinct difference between the self-deprecation both of them are guilty of. While Osako is self-pitying out of insecurity, he absolutely despises himself, and pretending that isn't true only makes him feel more miserable. This leaves him in an unwinnable situation, where he either pretends he's better at his own expense or be open and make everyone else suffer. Osako suggests to just be a better person, but he claims the road to self-betterment has been blocked off , having been punished for stepping out of line and now left feeling less human and more like some sort of pawn in a divine game of chess . He avoids explaining who punished him, much to Osako's confusion, only adding that it's hard for him to be honest when portions of his day seem to pass by without the slightest notice. He drops the discussion, letting Osako kick him around some more instead.",

Rather than accepting a plea of guilt, he repeatedly ask for more weight to be laid atop him. This incident was previously referenced during the event Della .",
