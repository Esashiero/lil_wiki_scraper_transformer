When they get there, Makoto tells him that he can't have sex with her â€” and that he should value her \"not as your sex slave or class president, but as a girl who puts you on a much higher pedestal than you deserve\". Sensei reluctantly accepts the situation. They talk about their relationship, and Sensei admits not knowing why she hasn't stopped doing his bidding a long time ago. She says that she looks up to him even though she shouldn't, and that she puts up with him in the hope that one day he'll see start treating her with the respect she deserves. They go to the inn.",
