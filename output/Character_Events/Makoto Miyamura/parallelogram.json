Before thinking, what he can possibly tell to uplift Makoto's spirit, he recalls childhood, the first time he saw death. In a second, both adults try to cautiously start a conversation with Makoto, but she dismisses her mother away, while spewing harsh and hurtful words. Sensei is desperately trying to talk with mentally and heart-broken Makoto. Shortly after, he sits next to her, and their talk becomes more personal. They discuss Makoto, what makes her closer to her mother. Sensei have said everything he could to show Makoto the brighter side of life, so the love still stays inside her ravaged soul. But the flood of thoughts inside her head leads to the unexpected turn of events.",
