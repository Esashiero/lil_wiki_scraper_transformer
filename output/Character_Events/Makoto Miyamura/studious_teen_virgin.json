        "synopsis": "Sensei invites Makoto to his house again, and to avoid a repeat of last time , he sends Ami on an errand to buy things which don't actually exist. Makoto knows why Sensei wants to see her, but doesn't like his blunt approach â€” she tells him that he should at least be nice to her when trying to be intimate with her, and hopes that one day he'll treat her more like a girl than a toy. Much to Makoto's aggravation, Sensei continues to refuse deepening their relationship. She proposes something \"pretty close\" as a consolation.",
