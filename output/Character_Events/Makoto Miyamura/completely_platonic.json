        "synopsis": "Sensei arrives in the first floor dorm hallway and knocks on Makoto 's door, and immediately receives a callout before he even has time to monologue. Makoto steps out and is surprised to see Sensei waiting for her. He asks to be let in to kill some time before leaving for the night, and despite being flustered and attempting to bring up legalities to stop him, Makoto eventually invites him in. Makoto, not used to this new situation, continues to fret over Sensei's presence in her room, and he reminds her she shouldn't be this phased since he already knows where she works . She tries to explain why that situation was different and how she and Sensei are different in that regard, but she almost starts fantasizing and has to pull herself out of her own head. She asks Sensei if it's okay to help him teach class at some point, and he says it's fine. Makoto eventually brings up their school encounter , and asks whether Sensei reserves that type of treatment for her specifically, but almost starts fantasizing again, and stops, apologizing for her erratic behavior. Eventually, she tries to ask again, and the conversation turns to how Sensei has been treating other girls in the class lately, namely Ayane . Makoto is annoyed when Sensei bluntly hits Ayane's view of him right on the nail, and asks whether he's been involved with Ayane. Sensei asks whether Makoto needs another massage, and she denies this but says she might allow him under other circumstances. They hang out for a little longer, before Sensei leaves and heads home to go to bed.",
