When they talk about their relationship, she asks to be Sensei's girlfriend, although immediately acknowledges that he can't say yes to that. She also talks about her parents' open relationship, saying that it made for a strange childhood, but that she still misses her father. Makoto tells Sensei that although her problems are \"infinitesimal\" compared to others, she still hurts sometimes, and he shouldn't think of her as invincible.",
