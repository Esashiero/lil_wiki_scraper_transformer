Makoto doesn't remember what she was saying before her migraine appeared, and returns to their conversation about how Sensei treats her. She says that some of the girls he is involved with are less well equipped than her to deal with the sadness they will face. She says that she's curious to know what it would take for him to drop everyone else and be with only her, but suddenly, Sensei is talking to Hope . Hope asks about how many hands a clock has, and says that Sensei thinks too much about the wrong ones. When he is back with Makoto, she considers him to have answered her question. Before they go back, Makoto tells him the results of some investigations she made regarding Yasu , Noriko , Maya , and Niki .",
