Sensei thinks about his relationship with Makoto — feeling \"particularly dark\" that night, he wonders if he has been having a negative effect on her. Makoto says that she has been \"slacking off\" lately, and is tired of \"giving 100% all of the time and getting like 4% in return\". She says that despite their sometimes combative relationship, he is important to her, and she knows that he cares about her too. However, she is still breaking. She leads him up to the highest rooftop, where she tells him that she is giving up. She wants to ask him for a favor, and he wonders if she wants him to kiss her. She asks him to close his eyes. She tries to become a bluejay, but to her confusion, she is immediately on the rooftop again. Sensei, unaware of what she tried but seeing that she is crying, leads her down from the rooftop — he's sure she will be fine.",
