They are interrupted by Makoto's mother, Maki . Sensei is alarmed when she recognises him, but Maki doesn't seem to find anything unusual about her daughter's teacher visiting their porn shop, and is more worried that Makoto will get in trouble for breaking school rules about jobs. Makoto herself is just embarrassed by the whole situation. Before Sensei leaves, Maki gives him her phone number.",
