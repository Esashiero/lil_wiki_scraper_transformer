She says that she had a good time, but suspects that any improvements to Sensei's behavior during the trip won't last. She tells him that she has been having vivid, recurring dreams about jumping from somewhere, and that she has a \"shadow\" inside her prompting her to do bad things. She\nsays that she's too strong to ever give in to it, but that she does have limits. Sensei tells her that he doesn't expect her to always be calm and composed, and that she can take time off class and helping him if she needs it. Before she goes, Makoto asks him to be honest about the fact that he's also in relationships with other people â€” he confirms her suspicions.",
