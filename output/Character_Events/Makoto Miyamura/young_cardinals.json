        "synopsis": "After another day of school, Sensei finds himself in his office with Makoto , signing papers related to the student's recent standardized tests. As always, Sensei finds himself exhausted from working only after a matter of minutes and tries to convince Makoto to forge his signature for him. She refuses to do that, both on principle and because she enjoys spending time with him like this. This doesn't sway his position and he wishes for the apathetic version of her to return, asking how he can get that one back. Makoto morbidly jokes that he just needs to kill someone important to her . Hearing this, he tells Makoto how happy he is that she's back to normal, which she interprets as flattery to get out of more work. He insists it's genuine, but also declares he'll only sign one more paper. She passes him one more test, which he identifies as hers, and quickly signs before suggesting the two of them relax on the couch – She turns him down, asking him to follow her somewhere else. She ends up leading him to the rooftop and Sensei observes as she bounces along the concrete, seeming much more chipper than the last time they were there. Makoto comments on the nice weather, which he takes as \"symbolism\" for her new, cheery front. Hearing this, she insists it isn't a front, and that she's genuinely optimistic about the future – Partially because she doesn't think it can get worse. She walks over to a nearby ladder, wanting to get a better view of the city. Sensei follows shortly after. As the two take in the view from the top of a water tower, Makoto tells him that she's happy he's here, leading him to quip that she's trying to lull him into a false sense of security. After confirming that's not the case, she begins to reflect on all that's happened since the last time they sat up there together. She asks if he still thinks she'll be a good teacher, which he confirms, adding that she already is one with how much of his work she does. She tells him she hopes to someday have the same ability to motivate people that he has, though jokes he probably only has it because his apathy makes people desperate to be the opposite of him. Wondering if she'll continue bullying him from now on, she answers ambiguously, confirming she's at least very different from the last time she was up here. She confesses that she's thought about \"leaving\" plenty of times, and had even written letters to Miku , her mom , Ami , and him at various points. While the thought of what life would be like without her around still plague her, she remains strong so that such a tragedy would never have to befall those she cares about. Realizing how heavy that topic was, she apologizes for being so somber, which, after some back and forth, prompts Sensei to repeat her line from earlier – He's happy she's here. Feeling a little embarrassed, she asks Sensei to close his eyes. He obliges.",
