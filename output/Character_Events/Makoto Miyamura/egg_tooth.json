        "synopsis": "Sensei arrives at the porn shop, and immediately, reality severely glitches, leaving him immensely confused. Makoto snaps him back to focus and he finds she's just closed up the shop and is getting ready to head back to the dorms. She tells Sensei she's more of a night owl, but Miku tends to freak out whenever Makoto isn't back at a decent hour since she can't stay up past 11 PM. Makoto says she'll just text Miku, and the two of them head to the urban district. Makoto asks Sensei if there's anything he wants to do, but he says walking is fine, dismissing the idea of dinner at 2 AM. They reach a higher area of the district and look out over the city as Makoto tells Sensei of her childhood experiences with her father, and Makoto asks Sensei what they are. She acknowledges that openly having the kind of life she dreams of would be virtually impossible, but insists on dreaming of that future anyway. Once the silence has stretched on for long enough, she tries to ask him if his answer to one of her questions earlier was actually serious or if he was just playing with her, but he pretends to be asleep to avoid answering the question, and after resigning to have made a mistake, she eventually uses a rideshare app on her phone to call them a cab. Makoto goes back to the dorms, and Sensei is dropped off at home, where he proceeds to go to bed.",
