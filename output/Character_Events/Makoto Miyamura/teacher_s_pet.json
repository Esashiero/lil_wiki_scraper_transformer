She notes that although there technically isn't a rule against him being there, it's still unusual, and wonders why he's there. She is surprised but pleased when Sensei says that he just wants to hang out. As the two are talking, Makoto makes a brief comment about how her mother is usually late to their get-togethers anyway, so she can just use Sensei as an excuse like she had been doing already, which Sensei greenlights. Sensei gets roped into answering a few questions about Makoto's opinions on becoming a teacher, both for his sake and her own, and he makes an inside reference to his own situation , which understandably goes straight over Makoto's head. They talk for a little bit longer before Makoto leaves Sensei to meet her mother, and Sensei heads home to go to bed.",
