She's immensely embarrassed and almost loses her temper on him, but he tells her he's not going to cause any problems or do anything to stop her, and eventually, she returns to what she was doing, though Sensei does decide to sit down next to her. She also decides to eventually bring him into the festivities. Afterward, Sensei cleans up and heads home to go to bed.",
