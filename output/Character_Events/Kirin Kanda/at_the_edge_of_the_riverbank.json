        "synopsis": "Sensei heads to the convenience store in the Old District , hoping to spend some time alone with Noriko , but Kirin happens to be there as well. The two girls continue their usual banter with one another, and their comfort with being so crass all the time continues to impress Sensei, especially considering their near-opposing stances on love. As the conversation goes on, Sensei wants to know if they have any normal interests in common, and Noriko can only name movies. Hearing this reminds Kirin that she needs to head home since she’s forced to attend a yearly tradition where she has to watch her parents' wedding video with the rest of her family. Needing to get some work done, Noriko suggests Sensei walk her home so they can talk. The two walk mostly in silence, only breaking it as they walk around the side of an old river. Kirin tries to pry into Sensei's relationship with both Makoto and Miku and, after having her attempt repelled, is reminded that she's currently mad at Sensei – Not only for abandoning Noriko during Christmas but also neglecting to inform Kirin about him and Miku . Sensei fails to see why he should regularly keep her up-to-date on his relationships in the first place, or why she'd even care. While she admits dealing with feelings is uncomfortable for her, she confesses that being excluded from such a big development involving two of her favorite people makes her feel left out. In addition, it makes her feel weird making a bigger deal out of the situation than both of them do. Sensei quips that her ability to play on both Miku and Noriko's “sides” is even more strange. She agrees, but isn’t concerned as long as Sensei can prevent hurting both of them. He doesn’t think that Miku will be a problem in that regard due to her \"openness\", which is something Kirin finds very surprising, and wonders if Miku picked that up from her. Sensei dismisses the idea since Miku is genuinely open to it while Kirin herself is simply pretending to be. When she tries to deny it, he decides to prove his point by proposing a hypothetical scenario – If he asked her to abandon everything she has in exchange for having him all to herself, would she take that opportunity. Kirin answers \"yes\" easily, and wonders why they can't just do that in the first place. Sensei answers that the two of them care about other people more than they admit and are simply hiding it because they both consider it a weakness. The two finish the walk back to the Kanda residence in silence, although, along the way, the two allow themselves to show their weaknesses.",
