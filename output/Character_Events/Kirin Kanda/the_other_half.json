        "synopsis": "While both take a walk through the hallways, Sensei thinks about how much of an enigma Kirin and her behavior are, an impression that is reinforced by her casually ignoring what just happened when it looked like she was hurt by it. Kirin tells him that he should stop trying to figure her out and accept her emotionless nature of their relationship. Sensei doesn’t mind this, but he tells her he also wouldn't mind absorbing some of her emotions. He tells her that she’s allowed to want and take more, and wants her to grow as a person, which includes allowing her to be more emotional and cry on his shoulder if she needs to. Kirin doesn’t want to do this and admits that this ‘temperamental brat’ personality is only one half of her. When Sensei doesn’t accept hormones as her other half, she explains that there’s no second half and that she just tries to find a substitute by others to fill the void. Both retreat into the boiler room for more privacy.",
