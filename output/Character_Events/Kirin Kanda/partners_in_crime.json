        "synopsis": "Kirin invites Sensei to her house. After they meet up, Kirin says that she expected him to be a bit hesitant about it, since he didn't seem as excited as she expected when she visited his office . Sensei finds it strange how openly she talks about things, and when he compares her to Ayane , Kirin is not pleased. At her house, Kirin talks about how she is often bored, and they talk about their interests. She asks him if he's in love with anyone, or is just messing around. Sensei finds Kirin difficult to read, and asks her if she is really okay with the relationship she proposed to him. She says that she really does want to, but can't do it right now . After a pause, Sensei figures out why not.",
