Kirin asks if Karin told her about her hurt ankle and wants Sensei to treat it with a massage. Miku disagrees with this, claiming that Sensei might not be as good as he said, but Kirin reminds her that having him as a coach and personal masseuse was her idea. She also states that Miku can only judge his ability if she received one from him, which causes Miku to avert her eyes, making Kirin suspicious. Miku gives in, allowing her to let Sensei treat her ankle in the store-room, and storms off. While Kirin doesn’t pressure him for information about Miku’s reaction in the gym, once they are inside the store-room, she wants to know if Sensei tried to advance his relationship with Miku. He admits that he did, but failed . Kirin promises that this won’t happen with her, but doesn’t want to do anything serious as, considering that they first met inside the store-room , it would be too romantic. So in the end, Sensei gives her a massage.",
