They talk about her self-consciousness around girls \"who are naturally better at almost everything\", and about her relationship with her sister. Sensei calls her a puzzle, and she wonders whether Sensei will be bothered to finish the puzzle that he considers her to be. She says that, between meeting him and meeting Noriko , things seem to be looking up a bit for her.",
