Sensei wonders if they're getting along, and Kirin says that although they both have issues, they add up to \"one socially acceptable human being\". Kirin and Noriko have established some ground rules about sharing Sensei — they have agreed to \"not screw around while the other is in the room\", and Kirin has promised not to develop any romantic feelings towards Sensei (although she claims not to be able to develop such feelings for people anyway). If Kirin breaks the agreement, Noriko gets to dissect her. Kirin claims to be totally fine with this agreement, but Sensei isn't so sure.",
