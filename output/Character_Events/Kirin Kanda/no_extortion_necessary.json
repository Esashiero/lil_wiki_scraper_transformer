She immediately makes her plan known and asks him to not kick her out if he doesn’t like her performance. Once Kirin has entered his room, Sensei asks if she's sure she wants to go through with it, given her nervousness last time , but she assures him that her nervousness was only a result of her being unprepared and that she’s prepared this time. When she's done, she leaves with a smile.",
