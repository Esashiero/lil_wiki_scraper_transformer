She asks him whether he has ever masturbated to her before, saying that she won't think it's weird and that guys \"jerk off to anything\" (including, in some cases, cartoon ponies, although she kicks him out of the house if he says that he's in that group). If he admits to jerking off to her, she is pleased, and says that she also thinks of him like that. If he declines to say, she calls his answer boring and gets annoyed. Either way, however, she asks to make out on the couch. After a while, Karin comes back, and Kirin quickly jumps away from Sensei. They make some feeble excuses as to what they have been doing, and Sensei leaves.",
