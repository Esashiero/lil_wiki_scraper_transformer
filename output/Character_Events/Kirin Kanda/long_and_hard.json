If he had an encounter with Kirin and Ayane during their beach vacation, he raises it with her â€” she gets angry when he doesn't show the \"right\" reactions, and tells him that she isn't obliged to explain herself or let herself be \"fixed\". Kirin says that Sensei's desire to figure her out is boring, and that they should make out instead, but Sensei tells her that he has to go.",
