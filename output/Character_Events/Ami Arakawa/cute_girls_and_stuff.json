Sensei suggests that she get one, and although Ami points out that cooking and cleaning for Sensei practically is her job, she considers the possibility. When he suggests the maid cafe he visited with Maya , Ami becomes suspicious that he's become addicted and is spending all his money there. If so, she wants to work there so she can keep an eye on him (and collect his money). She asks him to go with her to the maid cafe sometime to ask about a job.",
