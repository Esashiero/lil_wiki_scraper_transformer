They talk about their relationship, with Ami extracting a statement of love from Sensei by threatening to stop cooking for him. She tells Sensei that he's \"putting roadblocks all over this relationship\" by being older than her and related to her. They spend nearly the entire day watching anime together, and Sensei reflects on how good a life he has. Afterwards, Sensei takes a bath. If Sensei has fingered Ami before, she joins him and they have sex â€” otherwise, he just naps until dinner.",
