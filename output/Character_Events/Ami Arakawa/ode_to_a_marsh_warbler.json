They are, in order: \"This is only the beginning. The days that have yet to come will wash over you, like a partially detached showerhead, spewing the sea out of itself in an effort to make you clean. But you will never be clean. There are simply some things that become soiled beyond recognition. This is only the beginning. Greetings, you who are highly favored. The world is your clam's tongue. And you will change those who need it most. You must. This is only the beginning. And I will watch you every step of the way.\" \"Himawari-hatake, sore wa anata ni hanashikakemasu. Kiite kudasai. Semi no nakigoe, kaze ga nakimasu. Makasete, watashi ga anata wo tasukemasu. Anata no me ga daisuki. Anata no me ga daisuki. Anata no me ga daisuki. Anata no me ga daisuki. Anata no me ga daisuki. Anata no me ga daisuki.\" \"The sunflower field: it speaks to you. Listen: the cries of cicadas, the wind sings them. Leave it to me, I'll save you. I love your eyes. I love your eyes. I love your eyes. I love your eyes. I love your eyes. I love your eyes.\"",
