She has more money available now, and wants Sensei to come to the mall sometime and help her pick out a swimsuit (even though it's winter). Osako is also working, but would rather Sensei didn't look at her. Ami mentions being he third most popular maid at the cafe, and Sensei is curious as to who besides Uta is above her â€” Ami says that it isn't Osako, but has promised not to speak of the top-ranked maid (who may not be coming back anyway). Regardless of her ranking, Ami is determined to be Sensei's first choice.",
