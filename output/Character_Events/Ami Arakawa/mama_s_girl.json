        "synopsis": "During a regular night at Sensei's house, both Sensei and Ami are standing in the kitchen, the latter preparing dinner. As Sensei monologues to himself about how much he loves Ami, she playfully fights him off, trying to avoid him spoiling tonight's \"surprise\" dinner. He repeatedly offers to help, but she turns down each attempt, asking him to take a seat and relax. He complies, thinking about how Ami reminds him of someone he used to know. He refuses to elaborate further though, as the memories are too painful to bear. Ami soon walks over, placing down a large serving of curry in front of him which she denotes as being \"Special Ami Curry\". As he eats, she explains that it's special due to how rare it is that she'll make it, telling him to savor the experience. She negates his quip about simply needing to ask for curry if he wants it, reminding him that there are plenty of things she'd say no to – He simply never says them because he cares too much about her. He continues eating, with Ami revealing that he’s been speaking his thoughts aloud the entire time. Ami finds this endearing, enjoying the change from how reserved he usually is. Sensei is confused to hear this, and only more confused when she reveals he's currently in the middle of one of his \"blackouts\". She theorizes that it's because, unlike most of the other times it's happened, this specific incident was triggered by something she mentioned – Her parents. When she says this, Sensei immediately loses the ability to speak, going quiet as Ami decides to continue discussing them. While Sensei's never been particularly fatherly, she does like him a lot more than her real dad, admitting that might be because she was more of a mama's girl. Regardless, she did like her dad, and hopes he and her mother are in a better place now, even if her mom never believed in the afterlife. She recognizes that Sensei feels the same and laments how awful a fate that would be, desperately hoping that her parents are somewhere else. Noticing his silence, she assures him that she already knows how much they both meant to him and how amazing of a job he's done raising her. It's for this reason she wants to become more like her mother. Hearing this, Sensei regains the ability to speak, warning Ami that she doesn't want to be anything like her mother. She's confused by this and even more so as he struggles to articulate why she should avoid following in her mother's footsteps. Seeing him become increasingly distressed, Ami changes the topic, which fully breaks him out of his \"blackout\". Using this opportunity, she brushes of his confusion and instead starts to talk about Ayane and Maya , both of whom have begun spending less and less time with her. He dances around telling her why , having been given specific instructions to avoid the topic, but when Ami reveals Makoto 's already asked her about it he decides to relent – In a quick burst, he divulges everything he knows about Kumon-mi's time loops, the end of the world, and the various ways the girl's memories get overwritten. He's initially surprised when Ami doesn't interject as the rest should but is even more confused when Ami completely disregards the idea as dumb. He tries to convince her he's serious, but she repeatedly tells him to drop the topic and eat his dinner. Seeing how Ami has somehow lost her awareness and cuts him off whenever he tries to talk about it again, he takes one last look at Ami’s curry before proclaiming he lost his appetite.",
