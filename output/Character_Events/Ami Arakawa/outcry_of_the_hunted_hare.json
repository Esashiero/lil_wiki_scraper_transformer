On the ride, Ami recounts a dream where she got to dance with her mother. Arriving at her parent's grave, Ami stares in silence before slowly working up the courage to start speaking. She slowly works her way through all the things that've happened since their last visit . She eventually loses her composure and silently cries. Her mother pays a brief visit. Ami turns around and asks Sensei to say a view words of his own, but he decides not to. She then asks if the two of them can spend the whole day together, to which he agrees.",
