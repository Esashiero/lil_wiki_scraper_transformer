        "synopsis": "Sensei finds Ami fuming in front of the dorm hallway's messageboard, and asks her if she's okay, and whether he should come back at a better time, only for her to vehemently shoot that idea down. She also dramatizes Sensei's desire to visit her, and makes a rather dour comment about never talking to anyone else if he were ever to ask. When Ami mentions she's heading out for the evening, Sensei asks if he can come, only for Ami to mention that she's going with Maya , who has made it a point to never allow Sensei to join in any activity she happens to be a part of at the given moment. The conversation quickly turns to the living conditions of the dorms, and Ami makes an offhand comment that stokes Sensei's concern for his other students regarding their own living situations. Shortly afterward, Maya comes out of her and Ami's dorm, at which point Sensei and Ami are inadvertently forced to bid each other a quick farewell, Ami leaving with Maya to go to karaoke, and Sensei to head home to go to bed.",
