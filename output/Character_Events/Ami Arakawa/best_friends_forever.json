They describe themselves as the \"original Sensei Love Squad\", and say that they're not going to let Noriko take him away. They question why they don't have any solid memories of the Nakayama family if Sensei really has connections to them, and how Noriko could possibly have \"lost\" Sensei for three years. After telling Sensei that there's no one who wants his approval more than them, Ami and Ayane go to sleep.",
