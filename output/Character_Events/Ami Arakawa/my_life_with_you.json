Ami briefly tries to ask about what happened between him and Molly , being quickly shutdown and told to drop it. After a bit of back and forth, Ami reveals she's written a poem for Sensei for today.

Excited by this, Ami decides to try and show Sensei some poems her mother had written but blacks out upon opening the pictures up.",
