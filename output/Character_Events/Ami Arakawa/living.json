They end up hanging out in Sensei's room, and Ami becomes suspicious about how nice he's being. She talks about how they lived before Ami moved in with him, saying that they were both \"kinda just drifting\" and needed something to snap them out of it. Their conversation is briefly interrupted due to a weak connection. Ami is feeling tired, and falls asleep shortly afterwards.",
