        "synopsis": "Sensei wakes up on his first weekend in Kumon-mi, still at a loss for what to do with his time. He suddenly remembers that Ami 's room is right next to his and decides to spend his morning asking her for help on navigating the time. Upon stepping inside, he finds Ami sitting atop her bed. She apologizes for the mess he needs to wade through, having decided to take a break in the middle of cleaning. Confused by this strange amount of agency, he asks if cleaning is some sort of “hobby” for her. Hearing this, Ami asks if his memories are still missing, worriedly suggesting they go to the doctor in case something is seriously wrong with him. He negates this and assures her he just needs to get his bearings. Content with this answer, Ami clarifies that cleaning isn't a hobby, just a habit she picked up since he's never shown interest in doing it himself. She also states she doesn't need any payment other than his affection, something Sensei refuses to agree to, offering another incentive. Ami's upset by this denial and he attempts to defuse this by thanking her. This segues into him asking her how he used to spend his free time. Ami relays that he wasn't a particularly interesting person, but lists out various places he can go throughout the day for fun, including Koi Cafe , the library , the school's soccer field , the mall , the dojo , and the shrine . Content with all this guidance, Sensei takes his leave, wishing Ami luck with the rest of her cleaning.",
