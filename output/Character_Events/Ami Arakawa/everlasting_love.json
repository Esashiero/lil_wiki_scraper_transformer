Cuddling with Sensei on the couch, she says that she was a little hurt when he didn't object to her starting work — she felt that he didn't need her. However, she says that she intends to become the kind of girl he wants her to be. Sensei admits that he cares about Ami, although he declines her suggestion of staying the night on the grounds that Maya would kill both of them in their sleep. He does agree to go shopping with her and Maya for winter clothes sometime, however.",
