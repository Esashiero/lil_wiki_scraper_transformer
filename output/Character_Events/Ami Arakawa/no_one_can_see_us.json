She suggests that Sensei stay the night, and maybe \"cuddle\" a bit to help her fall asleep. Ami says that there's no one to see them, and she wouldn't care if there was. On the bed, she asks Sensei to imagine that they could be \"like this for the rest of our lives\", and asks what he'd do. She insists on a serious answer, even if it's \"something crazy\". Sensei then decides whether he wants to keep his current relationship with Ami, or change it in the way she seems to be suggesting.",
