Now having nothing to do, Ami demands he go with her somewhere, claiming she needs help \"carrying stuff\" before changing her excuse to being a private family matter. Sensei agrees to leave with Ami, and the two slide into a neighboring karaoke booth where she questions him on his relationship with Sana . When he fails to answer, she instead pretends to be Maya , hoping that will get him to stop ignoring her. It works due to his bad mental state, and he later realizes that he's done something bad again.",
