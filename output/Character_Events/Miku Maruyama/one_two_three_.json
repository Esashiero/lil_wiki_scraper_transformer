Despite Miku's comment that it never seems to rain, they are caught in a sudden storm, and the noise triggers one of Miku's panic attacks. Sensei connects to the one available network within reach, and pulls Miku under the nearest archway, where she latches onto his arm. It takes more than half an hour before she has recovered enough to head back to the dorms with him. She says that it is \"friggin' embarrassing\" that he stayed with her, but hugs him before she goes inside.",
