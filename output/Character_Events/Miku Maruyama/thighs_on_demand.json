Sensei points out that, despite Miku using it as inducement, he hasn't actually massaged any of the girls since becoming coach. Miku tells him to \"just walk up to anybody\" and ask â€” but not her, since she doesn't have \"experience in the sexy-department\". Even so, she ends up feeling \"butterflies\" when she gets up on his shoulders to reach some soccer balls. Afterward, she massages Sensei's shoulders for him, but says that she \"can't be lettin' things get any weirder\" with him because she knows Makoto really likes him.",
