Miku doesn't think that things should go any further, especially because of how Makoto would feel if she found out. She admits to certain feelings, but would rather ignore them until they go away. Sensei refuses to stop pushing and eventually persuades her to try something, but they are interrupted when Uta and Io drop a piece of furniture upstairs, causing Miku to have another panic attack. Makoto rushes in to help, telling Sensei to leave.",
