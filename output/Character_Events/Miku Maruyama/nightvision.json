        "synopsis": "Sensei , in a more upbeat mood than usual, heads to the soccer field and is greeted by Miku by way of her hugging him from behind. She comments on his abs, and lets him go so he can turn around. She asks to go running sometime, and Sensei declines, so she says she'll just jog instead. She tries to lift Sensei up and spectacularly fails, before inviting him to come and eat with Makoto sometime.  She says it'll be a good opportunity for them to get to know each other since she knows Sensei will eventually become the coach, and points out how he's the only teacher that shows up to school many weekends. A girl off to the side, who Miku says is the vice-captain of the team, blows the whistle and asks Miku to get some cones out of the shed, and Miku invites Sensei along to help her. They enter the shed, Sensei wondering why there's a mattress on the ground, and the two talk about the uses of the mattress before they get to work grabbing the extra cones. Before Sensei can grab any, though, he is startled by a soccer ball smashing into the side of the shed. Sensei turns around to find Miku has gone into a state of shock. Reality glitches as she starts screaming and grabbing at her hair, and two girls, Karin the vice-captain and her sister Kirin run into the shed to find out what's wrong. Karin immediately runs over to Miku and starts coaching her through several breathing exercises, and turns briefly to Sensei, asking him to leave and explaining that this is something that's happened before. She tells Kirin to go with him, and Kirin tries to protest, but a meaningful glance from Karin silences her, and she reluctantly agrees. The two walk about, and Sensei leaves to go about his day.",
