Miku is tired of waiting for Sensei to say yes to coaching the team, and simply proclaims him the new coach anyway. When Miku mentions the potential for massages, Karin becomes uneasy, but Kirin seems fine with it. To assuage Karin's concerns, Miku asks Sensei if he as any ulterior motives, and Sensei assures them that he \"won't touch anyone \"how they don't want to be touched\". Karin has reservations about that assurance, but Miku and Kirin override her. At Miku's suggestion, they all give Sensei their phone numbers (after some hesitation on Karin's part).",
