        "synopsis": "Sensei makes his way to the soccer field after an internal monologue about being at school despite it being the weekend, and finds Miku loudly talking to the other girls of the soccer team whilst trying to clean up the soccer balls laying around the field. She asks if he's stalking her, and after a quick reassurance that Sensei's intentions are nothing but pure, Miku gives him free \" Daytime Stalking Passes \". Miku asks Sensei why he isn't doing something teaching-related, and he quickly deflects onto another topic, not wanting to talk about teaching at all. She asks if he's there to become the new coach, and explains the situation despite being slightly disappointed when Sensei replies in the negative. Afterward, Miku explains what the soccer team was doing this particular morning, and when questioned by Sensei regarding the point of training for a live event when the city is under constant lockdown, Miku tries to explain how she and some of her closer friends and players are trying to keep morale and motivation up. The conversation quickly turns to how her studies are going after Sensei makes an offhand comment which leads him to discover she is actually close to failing most of her classes, and constantly has to ask Makoto for help studying. Sensei is also surprised to hear she and Makoto are best friends despite having seemingly nothing in common. They talk for a little while longer, and Miku tries to ask Sensei a second time to become the coach - which he shoots down just as quickly - before he leaves to go about his day, but not before receiving a soccer ball to the back, courtesy of a now-hysterical Miku.",
