There are things in Miku's past that are \"not really fun to talk about\", which she tries to push away. She steals Sensei's moment by anticipating his offer to help, and says that Makoto made the same offer. Sensei doesn't like the way she closes off her past, but Miku tells him to \"snap the heck out of it\" and adopt her positive outlook â€” if they're going to spend time with each other, she wants there to be smiles on their faces.",
