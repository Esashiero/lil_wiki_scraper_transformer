She says that she is trying to improve her response to loud noises, but still doesn't want to talk about the origins of her problem. She tells Sensei that they should not take things any further, and that it's less a matter of what she wants to do than of what she can do. She tells him that although she's easy to trick, he should \"stop makin’ things happen\". Instead, she proposes to support his relationship with Makoto — Miku says that while she and Sensei don't need each other, Makoto does need him. They are interrupted by Molly , and Miku goes back inside shortly afterwards.",
