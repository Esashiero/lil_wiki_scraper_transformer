        "synopsis": "Sensei arrives in the first floor dorm hallway and knocks on Miku 's door. She calls out that she's getting dressed, and quickly appears outside in his jogging attire. She asks him to join her on her nightly jog, and after some prodding and a promise to stick to a slower pace, he eventually caves and agrees, to Miku's joy. The two head outside the dorm and stand at the start of the street, and Miku tells him they'll follow her route since Sensei pointed out him leading might cause them to run into a dead-end. After Miku shows him the proper starting position, the two begin their jog, and Miku tells Sensei he's doing well, but she eventually notices he's running out of breath, and calls for a stop. The two sit down and take a break, Miku surprised that Sensei didn't call for a stop even once. She's not surprised when Sensei says this isn't something he's likely to ever do again, and she says she expected that, but she wishes moments like this could last forever because the other girls rarely join her for her activities. Miku decides to give Sensei her thanks, as even with just his presence and his shift in methodology, she's managed to recover a spark she thinks she had lost but for her nightly jogs. The two spend a while longer while Sensei catches his breath, and he thinks about his past life and whether he did any of this before, before the two of them eventually call it a night. Miku heads back to the dorms, and Sensei heads home to go to bed.",
