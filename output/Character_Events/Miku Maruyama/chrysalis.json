        "synopsis": "Sensei walks together with the girls and assumes that Miku , now that she’s able to explore her feelings and being someone who thrives with competition, will start to catch up soon. Miku asks Makoto about the painting she got and she tells her that she handed it to her mother . They ask Sensei about her situation with Molly and he tells them that hey resolved it and that she gifted him a shirt for the upcoming summer. Miku plans to get a new outfit for the new season and Makoto offers to cut her hair since it’s getting longer. Miku teases her about their new rivalry, but Makoto gets angry once Sensei joins in, claiming that he’s only taking advantage of her. Miku denies that Sensei does that, but Makoto flees when she gets too explicit. Sensei and Miku arrive at a park and decide to take a seat on a bench. Miku tries to adapt to her new feelings, but she still hasn’t found her zone yet and is unsure when she will be normal again, while Sensei says that there’s no need to become normal and that ignoring his advise isn’t normal anyway. She understands, tells him that what happened wasn’t his fault and that she feels bad since Makoto doesn’t know everything yet, including the incident at the hotel . She doesn’t know why she can’t tell her, but when Sensei explains that everyone is keeping secrets, she's sure that Makoto told her everything about them. He still thinks that it’s fine for her to keep some secrets and she agrees with a heavy heart. Miku feels like things are going too well for her and still thinks that Makoto deserves him more. She’s also feeling guilty for pretending that she has a clean slate when she only brushed of the most superficial dirt, but doesn't want to completely clean it because it allows her to be more reckless, though she hopes that nothing goes wrong. Sensei realizes that she isn’t only talking about Makoto and points out that he still doesn’t know about her past, but she isn’t ready to talk about it yet and rather wants to forget about it. Sensei realizes that she’s building a cocoon around herself and waits until she becomes a better version of herself, but ends up getting stuck whenever she tries to break out. For her sake, he decides to changes the subject to prevent an emotional breakdown and having to drag her to Makoto's workplace. She wants to prevent that as well since she doesn’t want to be around stuff she can’t comprehend yet. Sensei offers to educate her, but she demands a date before he does and, on that note, asks him if he can help her buy new clothes. He agrees, because he already has experience in choosing clothes for her , and asks when she wants to go. She tells him that he can call her anytime after her weekend practice and hopes that she can make Makoto jealous, but is ready to keep secrets when it’s necessary. They separate after that and Sensei goes back home.",
