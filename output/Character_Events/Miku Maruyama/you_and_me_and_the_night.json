        "synopsis": "Sensei arrives in the first floor dorm hallway and knocks on Miku 's door. He waits a minute, then knocks again, guessing that Miku is in the room but choosing not to respond. After a moment, Miku calls out, and Sensei tells her he wants to come in. He rhetorically asks her whether she thought he'd avoid her after her recent episode , and when she says yes, he becomes concerned and asks to be let in again. After a moment's hesitation, Miku eventually opens the door for him. Sensei immediately notices how dark the room is and Miku asks him if he's going to pretend that that event never occurred, and he asks her what she wants to do about it. She doesn't want to talk about it, so he decides to let it drop, and she asks him why he isn't mad with her. He lists off the things he likes about her despite initial protests over the phrasing of his compliments, and eventually says Miku shouldn't be so concerned about it, since some things are out of people's control. After a bit more explanation and Miku asking Sensei why he doesn't go talk to one of the other girls in class, he tells her briefly about his own problems, and says that everyone has their own. He suggests for Miku to just run faster the next time her problems try catching up to her, and she asks him or a hug, which he gives her. She tries to ask him to be the coach again and mentions the massage aspect, only for Sensei to attempt one. Miku stops him, saying she's not in the right mindset. The two get into an argument about whose willpower is stronger, before Miku apologizes for the event once more and offers to help Sensei if he ever needs it. She says they should go jogging sometime, and Sensei heads home to go to bed.",
