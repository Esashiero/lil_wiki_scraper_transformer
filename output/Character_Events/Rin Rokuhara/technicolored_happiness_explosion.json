Alone, Sensei and Rin talk about Rin's confrontation with Molly — Rin says that she feels like an idiot for not realizing Molly's feelings, but also says that she could not have made it clearer to Molly that she wasn't interested, and that Molly shouldn't have kept pushing. The subject of Rin's mental health comes up, and she says that she sometimes has a hard time being happy even when she should be.",
