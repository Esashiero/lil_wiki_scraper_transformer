        "synopsis": "Sensei heads to the cafe, but finds no one is there, not even Rin . Rin gets Sensei's attention, telling him that the cafe is closed for the day due to some kind of repairs, and that she was only here because Haruka needed her to assist with prep work. The two quickly leave the cafe and go exploring Kumon-mi, but Sensei quickly becomes annoyed that he still hasn't had his morning coffee. Rin eventually notices his demeanor and asks him, but once he points out his lack of coffee, she immediately apologizes for her forgetfulness. Rin is in the middle of reassuring Sensei they'll pick up a coffee at the nearest cafe, which Rin says is a good one, when she suddenly freezes, having spotted Kaori in the distance. She quickly runs up and tries to greet her, but Kaori is flustered from the shock of having Rin suddenly pounce on her, and she turns to Sensei to resolve the situation. He quickly reassures Kaori, allowing her to clam down for a moment while he addresses Rin on how she knows Kaori. Rin explains that Kaori is on Instagram and that she follows her, to Kaori's confused dismay, especially when she finds out some of her more private pictures are on the platform, and Kaori questions Sensei's loyalties. However, her dissent is utterly forgotten as Sensei and Rin are left completely sideswiped by Kaori's next comment - she says she's extremely attracted to him. Kaori quickly digs herself further into this new hole as Rin asks Sensei what he thinks, amid Kaori's embarrassed protests. After that is finally resolved, Kaori expresses frustration at her inability to get a pet from the pet store. Sensei suggests she pick up a stray, but Kaori says she can't, and quickly excuses herself from the conversation, leaving Sensei and Rin to think on the new developments. Rin is surprised at Kaori's flamboyant and eccentric personality, and the two discuss her before Sensei finally gets his coffee. Afterward, the two break off, and Sensei leaves to go about his day.",
