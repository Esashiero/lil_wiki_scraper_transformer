Rin is full of energy and enthusiasm, and eventually reveals that she has arranged to go an arcade with Otoha â€” she calls it a date, although she didn't say that to Otoha, and acknowledges that she doesn't actually know if Otoha is into girls yet. Rin is a bit nervous about how it will go, and Sensei and Futaba try to reassure her.",
