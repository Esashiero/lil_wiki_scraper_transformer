        "synopsis": "Arriving in the first floor dorm hallway, Sensei knocks on Rin 's door, hoping that she's inside. Rin steps out shortly, asking why Sensei is knocking on her door when she'd expect him to be literally anywhere else, and he comments he just wants to see his favorite barista - to which Rin gets defensive when he tries to joke about possible having others . Once letting him inside, Rin jokes about Sensei mugging her, which he catches onto and plays along with. When Sensei makes the atmosphere awkward unintentionally, Rin tells him not to look behind her, only for him to see, set upon a shelf above her bed, what appear to be real human skulls. Sensei tries to shift the conversation to Rin's other hobbies, but it proves to be a bit more difficult than he first thought when Rin, now privy to Sensei's knowledge of her skulls, casually tosses out a murder joke, at which point he awkwardly turns the conversation to the topic of Rin's music skills, only for Rin to be shellshocked to find out Sensei does not listen to music at all . After that, Sensei quickly bids Rin farewell and leave the dorms to go home and go to bed.",
