        "synopsis": "Sensei arrives in the first floor dorm hallway and knocks on Rin 's door, intent on checking up on her to make sure she's okay. After several seconds of silence, he knocks on the door again. After several cycles of this, he warns Rin that he will come in on the next attempt, and having received no response, does exactly that. Sensei is stunned to find Rin sitting on her bed in the darkened room - the only light coming from her dim computer screen - staring off into space and holding her bleeding arm, and the reality of Rin's situation suddenly falls into place in Sensei's mind. He tries to talk to her, only to be ignored, and even him bringing up Chika - a topic which normally leaves Rin very flustered - does nothing to snap her out of her trance. Out of options and wondering how bad Rin truly is, Sensei pokes her leg, which finally makes her realize his presence. Rin questions why Sensei is in her room, and in the process of Sensei's explanation, lethargically accuses him of wanting something more perverted, which Sensei denies in exasperation, as any such feelings he may have had before now are overridden with genuine worry and concern. She questions why everyone wants to help her, and after an attempt on Sensei's part to explain the situation and comfort her, she asks Sensei about what fate awaits after death. After a comment about the possibility of ending up in a different body - something he's considered has happened to himself in the past - he is disturbed when Rin lifts up her shirt, exposing her bare chest and making a blithe comment about wanting larger breasts. After a discussion on Rin's preferences which Sensei is extremely uncomfortable with given the circumstances, and a self-deprecating comment on her condition, she finally puts her shirt back down. She tries to say everything will be okay, which Sensei immediately doubts strongly, pointing out that she's already lied to him several times at this point, to which she has no effective counter. Sensei tries to make Rin promise to come to either himself or Futaba - who Rin says already knows about her issue. When that doesn't work out the way Sensei intended, he makes her promise to get some sleep. Surprised, she agrees, but asks him to hang around until she falls asleep. He agrees, still very concerned, and upon getting into bed, Rin passes out almost instantaneously, the stress of her condition combined with her physical actions having become too much for her body to maintain consciousness. Sensei hangs around for another hour or so to ensure she stays asleep. Afterward, he heads home to go to bed.",
