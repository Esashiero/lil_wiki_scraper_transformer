They talk about Rin's arm, the nature of pain, and what Rin was thinking about when she did it. Rin says that she is worried about ruining things with Otoha by pushing too much, and wants to know how Sensei managed to refrain from pursuing Chika when Rin asked him not to â€” or how he refrained from pursuing Rin herself. Sensei offers a few tips, some more helpful than others.",
