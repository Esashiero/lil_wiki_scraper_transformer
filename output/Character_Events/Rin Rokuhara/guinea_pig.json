She is surprised to find Sensei at the cafe, but quickly asks him for his order after making a comment about his 'slightly threatening aura'. After Sensei has ordered his drink of choice, Rin brings it to him, but comments that his election to stand instead of sit while he waits for his drink is making some of the customers nervous. He takes a drink, only to find it's nowhere close to what he ordered, and is slightly disconcerted that Rin has decided to use him as a guinea pig to convince her manager to add her custom drink to the cafe's menu. He assures he he does like the drink, though, and she brings him one of the comment cards for him to write down his experience on. The cafe gets flooded with customers, and Sensei is unable to talk to Rin after that point, so instead of waiting for a free moment which might not come for a while, Sensei places the card on the counter and leaves to go about his day.",
