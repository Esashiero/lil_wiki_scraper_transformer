        "synopsis": "Sensei arrives at the cafe and is confused to see Molly working – or rather, sleeping – behind the counter. Sensei uses a trick to wake her up and once Molly realizes that this isn’t a dream or isekai, she tells him that she has to cover for Rin because she has her date today, even though she worked the night before. Their conversation is interrupted when Haruka tells them that Rin just came in. Sensei asks why she isn’t on her date yet, and she tells them that she got ditched, though not because Otoha didn’t want to go anymore but because Otoha’s parents prevent her from going since her grades got worse. Since she has no alternative plans, Rin asks Sensei if she can spend the day with him and he agrees. After Rin vented her frustration and assured Sensei’s high status with her on the way, they arrive at the arcade. Both start with a racing game and once Rin explains the basic controls to him, she enters a competitive mindset and beats Sensei in every game they play. He doesn’t care about losing, though, since he was able to cheer Rin up after her original date was canceled and enjoyed being her backup date.",
