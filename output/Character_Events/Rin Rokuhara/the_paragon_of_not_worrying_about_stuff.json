They are interrupted when Rin freezes and drops a cup. Rin claims that it was nothing, but Haruka suggests that she take a break and talk to Sensei for a while. Rin spends the whole time talking about Otoha â€” she seems very confident about the future, but Sensei thinks that something feels off.",
