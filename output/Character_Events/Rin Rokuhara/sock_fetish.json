After the conversation gets past her initial topics of organ harvesting (she was watching a zombie movie earlier) and sock fetishes (her alternate explanation for why Sensei might be visiting), she moves onto something more serious — the latest developments in her \"hopeless\" pursuit of Chika . Rin is still obsessed, although she understands Sensei being a bit unsure of how to react to things she says given her recent problems . Rin reports having a successful conversation with Chika in which Chika said she looked cute, which Rin thinks is a big deal. However, she is well aware that her interest in Chika might not work out. She tells Sensei that she's glad to have someone like him to talk to.",
