        "synopsis": "Arriving at the first floor dorms, Sensei knocks on Rin 's door, and Rin immediately calls out to check who it is, letting Sensei in once she realizes it's him. Sensei tries to make her greet him properly several times, an effort which spectacularly fails. Rin mentions offhand that she has time to hang out with Sensei since Futaba won't be around for a while. The two trade banter for a minute or so over each other's personal preferences when it comes to clothes of various kinds, before the conversation turns to Futaba's crush on Sensei and his intentions on the matter, as well as Rin's suspicion Haruka is beginning to act the same way to a lesser extent. Rin postulates that due to this sudden revelation, Sensei might actually stand a chance with Haruka if he so chooses, despite her marriage - something which he wouldn't mind trying out. Afterward, Rin asks Sensei to tell him if he ever found out anyone they know is interested in her , something which he doesn't mind. However, he is slightly surprised to find out indirectly through remembering everyone he knows is female that Rin is actually lesbian - or at least she says as much, before clarifying she's actually bi, but vastly prefers girls over guys. Sensei quickly deduces the girl Rin wants to hear from him about is Chika , but he refrains from asking outright. The atmosphere quickly turns awkward after a series of revelations, including Rin's personal fantasies, and the two agree it's probably a good idea if Sensei leaves for the night, which he does promptly, heading home to get to bed.",
