        "synopsis": "The event begins with another open-ended intro, but this time it’s from Maya ’s point of view. Since this is Ayane ’s shtick, Sensei notices the inconsistency, but she doesn’t mind having her share one of her infinite life experiences, much to Ami ’s confusion. She instead wants to know what they want to do now, but Ayane informs her that she already made plans to meet someone. Ami is disappointed and Sensei wonders if everything is alright since her not accompanying her friends is a massive deviation, but Ayane assures him that she only needs to tie up some loose-ends. The narrator wonders who or what Ayane is going to meet. Turns out it’s Kirin , but he doesn’t want to see how this goes. Kirin greets her friend casually, but she tells her that they stopped being friends a long time ago, which makes Kirin wonder if that time was at the beach or in the hotel . She offers some interesting ideas for future shenanigans, but Ayane interrupts her and proclaims that while she can see Sensei behind her back, she won’t participate in any of her sick games again as she has no time to entertain her anymore. Kirin doesn’t want it to end, because she likes her reactions during their time together, reminds her that she agreed to her arrangement and, if she decides to back down, she won’t hesitate to ruin both their lives by telling everyone about them. Ayane gets close to her face and dears her to do it since she’ll still have Sensei’s love while she’s left with nothing after she does and prefers being called a whore than being around her. Kirin reminds her that Sensei’s career is on the line as well, but she doesn’t believe that even that would harm it, that Kirin couldn’t do it and that no one would believe someone as rotten as her in the first place. While Kirin says that she’ll regret her defiance, Ayane only regrets that she let it come to this and, if she knew then what she knows now, she would’ve prevented everything by just throwing her out at the beach like the parasite she is. Kirin brings up her father complex, which causes Ayane to lightly choke her as she tells her that while Sensei was a replacement for her father at first, they’re lovers now while Kirin is so unloved by her parents and overshadowed by Karin that it reached a point where she would do anything to feel alive. She also claims that she’s better than Kirin, because she embraces her flaws instead of using her insignificant issues as a flimsy excuse to insert herself into the ones of others, and suggests her to just stop getting between them. Kirin confesses that she was doing it to get back at her for her loss at the science fair , which makes Ayane burst out in laughter as she can’t believe how pathetic her reason is. She gives her a final warning and belittles her existence before leaving to see if she can still catch up with Sensei and her friends, feeling contempt that, unlike Kirin, she has people who care about her presence and shuts Kirin down when she tries to defend herself. As the scene fades out, the narrator heard that things went better than expected, which comes as a surprise since he’s so used to things going badly and repeat itself in a neverending cycle. The fact that things seem to actually change now interests him.",
