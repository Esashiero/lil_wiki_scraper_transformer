The two resolve to head over to the Koi Cafe, before Ayane hangs up, rushing out to go to the cafe. Sensei arrives at the cafe to find Ayane studying, and is surprised to learn she has already ordered a meal for him based on secondhand knowledge. The two have a conversation about why Sensei chose the cafe to meet up and what Ayane thinks this gathering means, Molly appears, asking for their order. After she leaves, Ayane questions some of the content of Molly's speech, only for Sensei to tell her to effectively save herself the headache. Ayane begins talking to Sensei about her falling for him, and posits the theory that her attraction to him may be some form of late-stage imprinting, a point which Sensei acknowledges, not really bothering to question its validity. The two banter back and forth while Ayane becomes increasingly embroiled in her fantasies regarding Sensei, until eventually, the two decide to call it a day, and Sensei leaves to go about his evening.",
