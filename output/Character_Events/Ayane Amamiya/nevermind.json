        "synopsis": "Sensei answers Ayane 's call, surprised to hear from her after she chose to skip the sleepover. While avoiding explaining herself, she asks if he's free to come to see her. Initially reluctant, he agrees since her asking him to meet up in the middle of the night is unusual. He asks for her location, assuming she's at her dorm, which she denies – She's at school and has a hard time explaining why. Once she asks him to head specifically to the roof, he notices that her laugh feels off, as if she’s trying to hide something, and agrees to meet with her before one of them hangs up. As he says goodbye to Tsuneyo , she tells him dinner will be ready when and if he returns. While confused by this ambiguity, he dismisses it, steps outside, and begins his walk. Along the way, he ponders over the reasons for the sudden invitation. He arrives much later than expected and Ayane is thrilled to see him, having started to worry. Looking up, the two take in the strangely beautiful night sky, with Ayane pondering if the sudden change in weather is an omen of sorts. Sensei jokes it's a sign of the impending apocalypse , which she plays along with before he broaches the reason for her sudden invitation. She tries to keep stalling but his unyielding curiosity forces her to drop the act. She asks for his approval, warning the reason might be something he doesn't want to hear. This reminds him of a prior prank she's pulled and he tells her off in advance. After a fit of silence, she asks for a hug, which he begrudgingly initiates. As the two of them hug, Ayane brings up a memory from their past, reminding Sensei of another one she shared with him. Hearing this, she reveals she made the latter memory up in an attempt to catch him lying. She explains that his constant jokes about his poor memory, in addition to his constant empty stares, have made her question if he has lost some of his memories; The possibility of him losing memories of their relationship in particular makes her extremely anxious. He reassures her that, while he doesn't remember their distant past, he can recall everything since they began getting close . He tells her the rest will return someday and that, even if they don't, there's nothing that can be done about it. Ayane struggles to approach the next topic, not being fond of change but feeling it's necessary in this case. Upon confirming that Sensei's aware of Ami 's feelings for him , she proposes that the two of them tell Ami about their relationship. Sensei immediately shoots the idea down and Ayane scrambles to explain herself. While the relationship between the three of them would be awkward at first, she feels it will pass since the three of them are essentially family. She also informs him that, ever since more girls started showing up , Ami's been increasingly scared of being abandoned and that knowing he hasn't begun to prioritize someone unfamiliar to her would help alleviate this fear. The hug breaks up with Sensei's mind unchanged. She questions if his hesitance is out of concern for Ami's feelings, or out of fear of their secret being exposed to more people – Such as Maya . Sensei fails to see how Maya plays into this, but Ayane reminds him of the hypothetical scenario where he only could choose one of them and thinks that his decision would surprise him. Having spent the entire conversation venting Ayane's worries, the two come to the same agreement: She shouldn't have skipped out on the slumber party as big, emotional bursts like tonight are \"out of character\". Drained from the long conversation, Sensei asks if there's anything he can do tonight to help her \"return to normal\". She tells him to keep being him but also to accept the parts of her he might not like, even if she never directly asks him to. He half-heartedly agrees and turns to leave once she begins to tease him about his obliviousness. As he's walking away, though, she calls out and begs him to stay with her longer, still having something to say. He patiently waits for her to build the confidence to say it. She fails, backpedaling even as Sensei tries to pry the answer out of her. With Ayane refusing to budge, he takes his leave, hoping that someday he'll become the sort of person she can rely on.",
