He asks if all is well, and Ayane is shocked to hear his voice from the other side of the door. After a brief bit of interrogation regarding whether it's really Sensei or just another of Ami 's pranks, Ayane rushes to let him into her room. Sensei reflects on just how much Ayane has to admire him for her to be fangirling that he's in her room, and goes to feel her mattress, at which point she talks about how she had it moved from her home on the first day of school and the hassle involved. Afterward, Sensei discovers a wall of photos of himself and a whiteboard with his name written on it numerous times, and plainly asks Ayane what the deal with said wall is. After the shock and resulting conversation of that revelation has worn off, the two end up talking about Ayane's growing desires, and Ayane makes a request to Sensei, which he decides to oblige, and he internally reflects on the potential consequences of that decision further down the line, before he decides to head home and get some rest.",
