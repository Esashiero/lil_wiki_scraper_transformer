Osako assumes that it's because Sensei is a distraction, but once she has gone, Sensei asks Ayane if she is okay. Eventually, she asks what she can do to make him want her more, and he says that she does more than enough already. She disagrees, saying that while some of the other girls might want him, she needs him. He says that she isn't giving herself enough credit. Ayane changes the subject.",
