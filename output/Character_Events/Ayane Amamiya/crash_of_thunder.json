Sana gets a call from her mother about a new employee, and Ayane gets sad — she tells them that she misses her own mother, whom she has been thinking about lately. She says that while her own parents don't seem interested in her, she intends \"to be the best mom ever\", even if she has to do it alone. She asks Sensei to tell her that he believes in her, which he does.",
