However, Ayane is acting out her part with too much dramatic flair and not employing her training the way she should be. The two become locked in a verbal spar until Ayane decides to pull an assault rifle from out of nowhere, and the karate instructor becomes immensely irritated offscreen to notice not only this, but the fact that the dojo has suddenly found itself in the company of an industrial fan. The 'spar' concludes and it is revealed this was not a battle, but simply Ayane showing Sensei what she thinks karate means, with the instructor now fretting heavily over the fan in the background. The two try to brush off the fan as no big deal until the instructor, very angry, walks up to them and demands the fan be removed within ten minutes or both of them will be thrown out of the dojo. Afterward, Sensei and Ayane break apart, and he leaves to go about his evening.",
