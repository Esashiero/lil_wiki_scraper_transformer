        "synopsis": "Ayane has reserved part of the bathhouse for just herself and Sensei . In the bath, Ayane proposes an \"experiment\" where they ask each other a question which they can't dodge or talk their way out of. Sensei agrees, but is worried that she'll ask about their relationship. Instead, she asks whether she would be a good mother, and is pleased when Sensei tells her that she would. Sensei asks his own question â€” if Kirin walked in on them during the beach vacation , he asks her to talk about that; if not, he asks her why she chose her question.",
