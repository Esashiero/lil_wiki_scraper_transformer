She would prefer not to talk about it, especially as regards the question of whether or not her father would help, but says that their best bet would still be to persuade Touka to change her mind. Ayane doesn't think that Touka is a bad person, just unaware. Ayane brings up the first Christmas that she and Sensei had together, \"reminding\" him of how he caught her and Ami kissing — \"just playing around\". Sensei regrets not truly remembering his past with Ayane (particularly that).",
