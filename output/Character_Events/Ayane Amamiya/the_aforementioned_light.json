        "synopsis": "Sensei knocks on the door to Ayane 's dorm, ready for a night free of the worry that's followed him so persistently as of late. As he steps inside, he feels safe, just for the briefest of moments. He stares silently ahead at Ayane, basking in the comfort her presence brings and the love she wears on her sleeves. The feeling is underscored by a feeling of unworthiness â€“  Something reminds him that he is undeserving of her comfort and love, and that even if he longs not to hurt Ayane anymore, he will, because he is pathetic. Ayane speaks up, happy to be able to spend some time alone with Sensei. However, he quickly notices the crack in her armor and easily deduces that something's wrong. Ayane admits this is the case, but refuses to acknowledge it or talk about it with him, not wanting to backpedal on her promise to be happier . Despite this, he implores Ayane to talk to him for once . She continues to try and push past the topic but stops in her tracks when he correctly guesses this is about Chika 's recent proposal . Realizing she can't avoid it any longer, Ayane asks Sensei to take a seat so they can talk. Before Sensei explains himself, Ayane asserts to him that, as part of her new strategy to avoid being stepped on, she won't allow anyone, including him, to trample over her feelings again. He understands this, and begins, explaining that Chika's proposal came out of nowhere and, even if he shouldn't have, he wanted to take full advantage of it. He wasn't sure how that'd make Ayane herself feel, just like he was unsure how she'd fare back during Halloween , but he made the choice he did because he didn't want to hide anything else from her. While she wants to believe him, Ayane feels like there's more to it, especially because of how warped Chika's perception of him is; Ayane might accept all the horrible flaws Sensei has, but Chika doesn't even know they exist. Sensei tries to defend himself, explaining that he had little control over how quickly his situation with Chika changed , but asserts that there is absolutely no hidden deceit in his words. Ayane scrambles to find some hidden reason, and Sensei takes the time to negate all of them. After his attempts to convince her of how nice the opportunity might be fail, Sensei promises to make sure she will be comfortable if she agrees to go through with it, but she reveals to him she's already agreed to it, and just wanted to spend tonight expressing her anger towards him for treating her like an afterthought. He tells her she's neither an afterthought nor some kind of sacrifice, and that he genuinely wants her to be there. This final bit of reassurance is enough for Ayane to relent and, while she makes a few passive-aggressive jabs at him and states that he owes her a favor, accepts his explanation. The two work out some specifics, with them deciding to call Chika over the upcoming weekend. The night draws to a close and while more happens that night, Sensei keeps them to himself, citing the privacy as something they deserve.",
