        "synopsis": "Sensei is on his way to meet Ayane at the dojo, but is surprised to find Ayane standing in front of him, and she explains that despite her fun-loving nature, she had wanted to practice her skills for real today, only to find that the dojo's been closed for the day. Ayane turns her thoughts to her love and desire for Sensei, much to his chagrin due to the two of them still being in a public, and eventually, they sit down on a bench to discuss. The conversation starts bouncing around several topics, not staying on any for very long, before Sensei asks Ayane if she's okay with the direction the night is heading. She replies she's fine with it, and after a particularly off-putting tangent about Ayane's feelings toward Sensei, she starts trying to come up with names for their future children. After a bit more banter and Sensei stopping Ayane from saying something he doesn't think she's ready to commit to yet, the two split up, and Sensei leaves to go about his evening.",
