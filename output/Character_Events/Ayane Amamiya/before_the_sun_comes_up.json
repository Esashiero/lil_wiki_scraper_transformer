        "synopsis": "The world now reset , Sensei opens his eyes to find that Ayane 's disappeared. He quickly asks Maya for an explanation, who theorizes that Ayane might have been \"factory reset\" in a similar way that he was when he first woke up . She also says it's equally possible she's back asleep in her Dorm. He questions how she can be so calm about that possibility, which she explains as being something akin to indifference — She's witnessed her friends being reset hundreds of times and has grown numb to it. He suggests the two of them should go check to make sure, though she asks him if he really wants to do that instead of just going to bed. After stepping way from him, she wants to know if he has an idea how Ayane could reach the rooftop in the first place. Sensei's unsure, having hoped she could explain it to him; While Maya hasn’t a definitive answer, the most plausible theory she can think off is it’s because \"he’s disgusting\", and that he should try to be less so in the future if he wants to prevent further complications. The two make it to the dorms, with them parting ways as Maya turns around to pick up some things she left behind. As Sensei approaches Dorm Room 2, he hesitates at first, but eventually succeeds in knocking, unintentionally waking up Sana who steps out to greet him. Extremely tired, she asks why he's at the dorms so late. He asks if she can wake up Ayane but Sana is confused, asking who Ayane is. He begins to panic, struggling to process the idea that Ayane could have been wiped out of existence. As the thought sinks in, Ayane walks up behind him, just as confused as Sana about his sudden appearance. While he basks in relief, Ayane explains that Sana's worrying response is due to her being mostly delirious when woken up late at night. The three head inside the dorm room and take a seat on Ayane's bed, with Sana falling asleep on her lap. He quickly notices reddish circles underneath Ayane's eyes but doesn't comment on them, assuming she'll deflect the topic like she always does . Instead, he jumps into the main topic, asking about the roof. As Maya predicted, Ayane has no memory of the reset. In fact, her memories create more contradictions with his own when she fails to even remember the sleepover she skipped out on. Realizing she doesn’t remember their earlier meeting either, he pries and gets her to reveal that their talk took place in the same park they and Sana visited before . He tries to remind her of what actually happened but is unsuccessful, instead moving on and asking why she's coming home so late with red rings under her eyes. She meekly explains that, after returning home, she went to bed but awoke from a dream she couldn't remember with the feeling she'd lost something important. Confused, saddened and a bit angry at herself for forgetting, she decided to make a late night trip to clear her head since she didn’t want to bother him again. Now thoroughly confused but content to know Ayane's okay, Sensei decides to take his leave. She invites him to stay the night, but he refuses, saying he needs to check in on the supposedly fabricated sleepover. Sensei walks home, mulling over his confusion, and unnerved that resets have the power to drastically alter past events. Along the way, he feels as if he's lost something important too.",
