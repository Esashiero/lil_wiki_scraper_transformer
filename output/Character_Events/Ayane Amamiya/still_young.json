Sensei is alarmed, and Ayane asks whether it would really be so bad. She tells Sensei that he's all she has, and that even though saying so makes her sound crazy, she is \"addicted\" to him. She asks if he remembers the first time she broke down in front of him, when he comforted her after her mother had moved out and told her that he would always be there for her. Now, with her father ignoring her, she feels that there is no one to look after her anymore. Sensei tells her that he'll keep visiting as much as he can. She asks him to sleep next to her overnight, even though Sana is certain to notice. If he agrees, Sana accepts his explanation.",
