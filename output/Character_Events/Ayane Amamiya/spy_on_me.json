        "synopsis": "Sensei arrives in the dorm hallway to find Ayane knocking loudly on her dorm room door. Ayane immediately begins to flirt with him, only to be surprised when he immediately deadpans the response she was hoping for. Afterward, he asks why she isn't in her own room, and she says she believes Sana has subconsciously locked the door in an effort to stay asleep longer, despite asking to have been awoken ten minutes earlier. Makoto tries to assist from the other side of the hallway, but Ayane insists she can handle the situation on her own. Ayane asks if Sana can tag along on whatever she and Sensei were going to do, only for Sensei to say he wanted to be alone with Ayane. He allows her fantasies to run wild, which disgusts Makoto, but Ayane casually ignores Makoto and rebuffs Sensei briefly, to his surprise. Afterward, Ayane says they'll have to reschedule their alone time, due to Sana's current stubbornness, and laments that Sana won't be able to assist her in completing the year's science project - which Sensei hadn't even known about beforehand. She makes a comment about the project supposedly having the ability to bring the dead back to life, before managing to get into her room, leaving Sensei utterly bewildered at her door, until he finally leaves to head to bed.",
