Ayane is flustered when Sensei mentions how her reaction to walking in on him runs counter to her claim of building up her bravery and strength to 'take back her lands'. The karate instructor yells from the side for Sensei to either pay up or get out, and Ayane repeatedly presses this dialogue to attempt to get Sensei to join as an excuse to spend more time with him. When he finally caves and agrees, she runs off to sign the necessary paperwork, something that worries him greatly, before he decides to leave and go about his evening.",
