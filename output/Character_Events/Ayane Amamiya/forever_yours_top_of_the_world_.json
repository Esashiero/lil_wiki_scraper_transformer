Ayane is concerned that Sensei seems to not be having a good evening, which Sensei understandably has no response for. Ayane confides in him that there are secrets she keeps hidden within herself as well, even from him, which takes him by surprise a bit before he makes an offhand comment which Ayane interprets as romantic, much to her own shock. Afterward, the two sit atop the water tower that sits atop the school's roof and talk about Ayane's childhood and how climbing as high as she could helped her to get away from everything and calm her worries, something which Sensei internally sees the merit in, even though he has a snide comment about it. Afterward, the conversation quickly devolves into Ayane wanting to explore her desires physically and open up to Sensei, something which he reciprocates, but asks for a promise that no one will ever find out about the event. Ayane has no trouble agreeing to this, as she had already seen it from his point of view and has internally vowed to do whatever she can to help him be happy. Ayane quickly begins to drag Sensei back through the school.",
