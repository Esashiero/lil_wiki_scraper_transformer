        "synopsis": "Sensei arrives in the first floor dorm hallway and knocks on Ayane 's door, but is surprised when Ayane opens the door immediately, explaining she had been jumping at the slightest noises in the hallway, presumably to wait for him. Ayane's excited and boisterous chatter proves a little too much for Sensei to handle in his current state, and he asks her to stay calm while they're out and about - or at least as calm as Ayane can be around him. As they walk, Sensei finds himself talking to Ayane about her recent purchase of hermit crabs and her butler, of all things, but when the conversation becomes awkward and Ayane tries to turn it to her love for Sensei, he internally laments the difficulty he has in keeping up with her in normal conversation. Ayane eventually talks about her desires to stay in Kumon-mi and how she thinks a lot of things happen in the city. Suddenly, Sensei gets a bit of whiplash when Ayane suddenly steers the topic to their first words as babies, and she guesses that due to his experience with the fairer sex, his first word must have been 'Mama'. He subsequently guesses hers was 'Dada' or 'daddy', but has to immediately apologize when he remembers her slowly degrading relationship with her father, and she blows it off before asking to stop at a convenience store - Sensei is astonished when she mentions how she's been banned from several already. Alter, they finish their outing, and Sensei heads home to go to bed.",
