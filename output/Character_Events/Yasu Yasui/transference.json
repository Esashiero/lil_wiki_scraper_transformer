Yasu is pleased to see him, but says that he can't go inside this time â€” God is mad at him for some reason. Instead, she talks about her beliefs on how people can serve as vessels for God's warmth, how it differs for girls and boys, and what role Sensei could play in transferring \"warmth\" to girls if he would only open his eyes.",
