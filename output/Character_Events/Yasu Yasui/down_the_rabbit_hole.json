        "synopsis": "Sensei decides to visit Yasu at the church. Once he enters, he finds her having a tea party with some stuffed rabbits. Being fascinated by how she tries to quell her loneliness, he decides to watch her, until she acknowledges his presence and asks him to join them. Sensei wants to know what she’s celebrating with the rabbits and she explains that it’s a summer ceremony to welcome the coming return of their god, which includes drinking tea made out of leaves and water found around the cathedral. She offers him some tea as well, but he declines but takes a seat on the table. He notices that the chair he picked was left empty and wants to know if she anticipated his arrival, which she confirms. She offers to answer any question he may have, but he just wants to hang out with her as a friend. She tells him that they can’t be friends, because she is unworthy of being one and has a higher role to fulfill. He thinks this is about them filling the world with light, but she didn’t mean that. She explains that His voice becomes clearer in summer and, as a result, so do the tasks she has to fulfill. Yasu has another mood swing, reaffirms her role as His messenger and wants one of the rabbits named Wormwood to explain it to him. Before Sensei can decline, Wormwood starts preaching to him about how he has to fulfill his role as well. Yasu continues and, when Sensei tries to answer one of her questions, cuts him off, claiming that he hasn’t the right answer even after all He has done for him. Sensei tells her that He hasn’t done anything for him, that he doesn’t believe in the existence of any god and that Yasu can follow any believe she wants but can’t shove her believes down everyone’s throat. Yasu, smiling creepily at him with tears in her eyes, says that his presence is proof that he wants to be part of her religion, because he wouldn’t be here if it weren’t the case. Her behavior gets more extreme and she demands from him to come closer and rub His scent on her, until she gets a headache and starts switching between being in pain and creepily preaching to him, with Wormwood giving him a final message. Sensei, being genuinely worried about her, has enough and wants to help her, but when he looks back at her, no one’s there and the tea party has vanished. He believes that everything was a delusion and goes back home.",
