She has blindfolded herself with tape, which is \"simply how we show our thanks\". There is a connection error, and Yasu tells an anecdote about a blind man who collects eyes, gains sight through memories from those eyes, and then has it withdrawn again. She has foregone her sight so that he can see in her place, although without many happy memories, there is only so much he can gain from her.",
