        "synopsis": "Sensei visits Yasu in her dorm room (after a brief mental detour). She is sitting in the dark, and says that sunlight hurts her eyes and skin (as well as being religiously unimportant). She has a sudden urge to go for a walk, and they go to the park where Sensei (and Sana ) first met her . They talk about Yasu's youth, the nature of souls, what happens after death, and the whispers which supposedly surround everyone. Sensei considers her views to be crazy, but she says that her views are a perfectly rational response to what she (and she alone) can see around her.",
