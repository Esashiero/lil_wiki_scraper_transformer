        "synopsis": "Sensei knocks on dorm room #9 to visit Yasu , but Touka comes out instead. After admiring her figure, he asks her if he can see Yasu, but she warns him that he shouldn’t do that today since Yasu is acting even weirder than usual, which is why she left the room in the first place. Sensei still wants to see her and, after teasing her again, Touka doesn’t care anymore and lets him in. He enters the dorm room and thinks that, after everything he witnessed, he can handle whatever Yasu is going trough and gets immediately proven wrong. Yasu is standing on her chair and praises Him. She finally hears His voice again and wants to lend Him her body so He can speak. Sensei doesn’t believe her, but she goes into a trance and speaks inaudible sentences. Sensei explains that this phenomenon is called Glossolalia, but thinks that it’s just an excuse for believers to feel closer to something that doesn’t exist. Yasu breaks out of her trance and feels her body heating up. Sensei wants her to get down, but she asks him to catch her when she falls. He tells her that she won’t fall, because she can still speak in coherent sentences and, therefore, should be able to stabilize herself, but she tells him that her legs have gone numb. He notices that her legs are shaking, but realizes that it’s not due to a lack of balance but due to her subconsciously grinding her thighs against each other. Yasu falls down, lands on Sensei and rests her body on him. He notices the heat emanating from her body and recognizes it, which fills him with unease and curiosity. Yasu places his hand on her chest and he confirms that Yasu is aroused. Since He told her that Sensei can help her with that, Yasu begs him to get rid of the heat, but, since she isn’t aware of what she’s doing or feeling, he tries his best to not act on his desires. She continues holding his hand on her chest until she feels something. Suddenly, Sensei finds himself in his room with Yasu’s body looming over him. Something seems to have taken control of her and ridicules Sensei’s decision not to take Yasu when it offered her to him, threatens to take away the one whose smell is still lingering in his house and demands that he takes something he isn’t meant to have before winter returns. The next minutes are a mixture of pain and pleasure, until Sensei finds himself back in the dorm room as Yasu reaches an orgasm from massaging her chest. Sensei is happy that nothing happened that could’ve destroyed their relationship, but also agrees with Touka how he shouldn’t have come tonight.",
