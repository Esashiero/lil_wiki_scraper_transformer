        "synopsis": "Sensei enjoys a quiet day in his office, until Molly and Futaba enter and request his help to educate Yasu on manga, despite the fact they’re aware that he knows nothing about them. He leaves his involvement to Yasu since she ghosted him last time, but she has no clue what he’s talking about. He tells them what he experienced during her tea party , but Yasu says that he never appeared to the party, that she waited for him until Touka sent someone to pick her up and how sad she was when he didn’t visit her that night. Sensei wants to make sure if she’s sure, even naming the rabbit Wormwood by name, but she’s absolutely sure, thinks that he should’ve drunk the tea she made if he were there and tells him that he has to wait until next summer to get His blessing. Sensei decides that his memories are a result of Yasu being insane and another instance of time going by without him noticing , but is also glad that Yasu wasn’t ghosting him on purpose. Molly gets the conversation back to Yasu’s education on manga. They want to figure out what genre she likes and want Sensei to help them since Yasu specifically requested his presence. However, he is neither able nor interested in helping them, until Molly mentions that Yasu wants to put on a costume for him. He follows them to the club room and waits outside with Futaba while Molly helps Yasu change into her costume. Once she’s finished, Sensei enters the club room and Yasu is dressed as a fire mage, trying her best to get her signature line right. He compliments Yasu and thanks them for being able to witness another fashion show . After admiring her performance, the girls try to help Yasu find an introductory manga. While she has no idea what she likes, she doesn’t want anything that contains gratuitous violence or premarital sex, which eliminates everything from Rin ’s collection. Molly and Futaba ask Yasu some questions to figure out her boundaries in regards to violence and romance. Sensei watches them for a while before picking a random manga from Ami ’s pile and, after skimming trough it, recommends that one since it’s a tame story that contains neither violence nor sex. Molly explains that he picked a slice of live story and, while it wouldn’t be her first choice, recommends it as well. Yasu gets excited and starts reading it for the rest of the day.",
