        "synopsis": "Sensei knocks on the door to Room 9, hoping to speak with Yasu but is certain that Touka will be the one to answer instead and that she will probably confront him about their recent excursion . Upon stepping inside, his suspicion is confirmed true, and he quickly takes responsibility to push the conversation along to a more pressing topic. He asks Touka if she believes there's any shred of truth to Yasu's religious fanaticism. Touka tells him there's truth buried in every faith, and that it wouldn't be strange since all faiths are built on the same tenets. He clarifies that recently she seems to be causing him to see things, has learned things she shouldn't, has successfully predicted the future, and seems to let something else speak through her. He asks if she's experienced these things too, which she denies, inquiring further into Yasu's supposed predictions. After being told about her predicting the death of Makoto’s father and knowing when the seasons are going to change, she dismisses them as vague generalizations, the same ones psychic mediums might use. As she tries to explain further, Sensei suddenly struggles to understand her, and his vision abruptly goes dark. Something intervenes, relaying that Yasu is defective and telling all \"readers\" to dismiss any information about her as it's a waste of time. Something else intervenes and loads a memory: In the past, Yasu finds herself staring blankly at the floor while her mother argues with a doctor. The doctor tries to calm her mother down, insisting that her daughter suffers from schizophrenia, a common yet complex brain disorder. Yasu's mother insists the doctor is wrong as Yasu's father has started to see things too, and Yasu keeps predicting the future. He dismisses all of these as a mix of overactive imagination and coincidence, further infuriating her. The doctor tells her to heed his advice, as schizophrenia has some serious drawbacks that could endanger Yasu's life. Yasu's mother argues that Yasu ends up regurgitating every medication they give her, making her miserable as a result. Hearing this, the doctor decides to refer Yasu to another clinic that offers antipsychotic injections instead. He tries to warn about the side-effects of these injections but Yasu's mother, completely fed up, just wants the referral so she can get on with her day. The doctor also suggests to have her husband checked as well to determine if Yasu got her schizophrenia from him, but she insists his “symptoms” appeared after Yasu was born, calling her a monster. Going to leave, Yasu's mother beckons her daughter to follow, but Yasu remains unresponsive, causing her to get increasingly agitated. Back in the present, Yasu snaps out of her flashback and joins Touka and Sensei's conversation. However, she continues to believe she's in the past and mistakes the room for a doctor's office, much to Sensei and Touka's confusion and discomfort. Sensei ends up leaving when it's clear Yasu's not fully there. Now alone together, Touka tries to get an explanation for her strange behavior, which causes Yasu to inadvertently reveal what happened every time she visited her physician. Realizing that the physician took advantage of Yasu, Touka begins to cry and tells Yasu to make preparations, as they'll be spending the night at her estate instead. Back at his place, Sensei receives a call from Touka, who wants to know how trustworthy he is. He asks if anything happened with Yasu that warrants that question, and while she confirms this, she doesn’t want to talk about it yet, but has to make sure he treats Yasu as he should instead of seeing her as a toy for his amusement. He asks if he isn’t doing that, and while she can tell that he is, she knows that someone else hasn’t – And she won’t let it happen again. Falling asleep, he realizes just how much more complicated his relationship with Yasu has become.",
