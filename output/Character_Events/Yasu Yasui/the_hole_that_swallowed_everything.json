She talks about opening his eyes, being cleansed of filth, the funny thing about morals, and her ability to swallow all sort of horrible things (the latter prompting an interjection from Kirin ). Finally, she invites Sensei to a sanctuary where God does not live, but very much likes to visit. He deduces this to mean a church, and reluctantly agrees to see Yasu there sometime.",
