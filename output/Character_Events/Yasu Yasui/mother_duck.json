        "synopsis": "Despite past experiences, Sensei decides to pay Yasu another visit at the church. When he arrives, he finds her standing in front of closed doors, desperately trying to get inside. She thinks that she’s being punished for committing a sin and wants to repent, while Sensei thinks that someone just locked the door to mess with her, even though he can’t think of anyone who would want to do that. She begs Sensei to open the door, since he should be on His good side, but he doesn’t bother trying to open a clearly locked door and thinks that she shouldn’t try to sneak inside, if she committed a sin. He wants to know what her sin could be, but she can’t recall anything and the only new thing she did was reading the manga , which should’ve been fine. She has another mood swing and asks Sensei if he knows what abandoned ducklings do. He thinks that they latch to whoever is close, but she adds that it will die when it doesn’t find a suitable replacement. Sensei points out that, according to her believe, there’s no death, but she explains that people still can die if they’re abandoned by Him. Since they can’t do anything here, Semsei recommends Yasu to go somewhere else with him, but she’s unsure what to do now that she’s without guidance. He tells her that she should make a decision for once, but she tells him that deciding to follow him would make her a follower and a leader and if he thinks he’s worth following, he would see himself as an interim deity. He has no interest in this discussion and decides to leave and, as he expected, Yasu follows him. He leads her into a dark alleyway and while he finds the smell revolting, he notices that Yasu is unfazed by it, realizing that something like that makes her feel more comfortable than her dorm room. He assumes that this never happened before, which she confirms. He tries to convince her that her time is better spend in her dorm room, but she needs His guiding light to survive. He asks her about her past before she became a messenger, but she tells him that there was nothing before He appeared. She points out that Sensei also doesn’t share his past and claims that she knows enough about it to cause a tragedy if she shares it. He doesn’t believe her, but she’s fine with that, because she knows what will happen and waits for him to embrace the truth He will give him. Sensei still has no intention to believe in Him and Yasu promises that she will make him. She continues preaching, but Sensei doesn’t pay attention to it and contemplates how he should’ve brought her somewhere darker to get a chance to learn something about her.",
