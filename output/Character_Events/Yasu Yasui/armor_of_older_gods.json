He thinks for a while about religion and its uses (but not about perception). Yasu is pleased to see him, and talks about how those who \"make a big enough dent in the armor of older gods\" can graduate and become \"angels\" who \"decide who stays and who goes\". She also talks about whether the transference she previously mentioned would or would not involve \"touching\", and about how God's needs should be paramount in the process. Sensei is unconvinced, but says that he will keep visiting her.",
