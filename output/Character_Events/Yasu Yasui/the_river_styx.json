        "synopsis": "After what happened last night , Sensei decides to stay in his office to prevent himself from witnessing Nodoka getting murdered and Yumi self-destructing her progress in fixing her reputation. Touka knocks on his door and, after hesitating, he lets her in. She wants him to take care of Yasu , because Yasu doesn’t want to attend class today and she has to clean the archery range, so she can’t deal with her. He doesn't want to handle her after his last visit , but doesn’t tell her what happened. He informs her that he doesn’t want to attend class today either, but Touka congratulates Yasu on spending time with him in his office and leaves. Sensei asks Yasu why she doesn’t want to attend class and she explains that the world said that something bad is going to happen. He tells her that she should face whatever is going to happen, because if she learns how to deal with conflicts now she will be prepared for when they’re unavoidable. He wonders if she has divine protection, but, after a moment of silence, she admits that she can’t hear Him since Sensei’s last visit, which is why she has to make sure that nothing happens to her. He asks her what she might’ve done this time, but cuts her off when she mentions an outpouring of holy pleasure. He assures her that she will be fine and wants her to go back to class, mostly because he can’t be with her for a prolonged period of time, but she has no idea where the classroom is, because Touka just grabs her collar and drags her to wherever she needs to be, so he agrees to bring her to the classroom. On their way, Sensei asks her if she can hear the world again, but she tells him that, while she does, she can’t understand it. They reach the classroom, but Yasu wants him to stay with her for a while and he gives her five minutes. As they enter the classroom, Yasu latches onto Sensei’s arm. Sensei doesn’t think that anyone will pay it any mind since it’s Yasu, but stands corrected when Futaba approaches them. Before she can ask him, he explains that this happens against his will and that she’s scared. Futaba wonders what she’s scared about and she gives an explanation about sky tendrils, which gets Nodoka’s attention.",
