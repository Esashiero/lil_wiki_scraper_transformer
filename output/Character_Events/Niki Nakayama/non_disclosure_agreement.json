Ayane, barely containing her fear, insists that nothing has changed and that Ami's just as important as she always has been to her. As the prying continues, Ayane becomes increasingly uncomfortable, eventually deciding to take the blindfold she's been wearing off. Ami leaves her behind. Back at the inn, Imani leads both Sensei and Wakana to their room so they can relax after all the chaos of the swimsuit contest. Upon stepping inside, though, they find Niki there waiting.",
