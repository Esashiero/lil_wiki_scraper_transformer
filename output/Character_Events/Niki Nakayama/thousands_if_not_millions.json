Kaori's comments about their current relationship prompt them to start talking about their past, which Kaori decides isn't conversation she should be part of. Niki tells Sensei that although she spent a long time dreaming of punishing Sensei by forgetting him like he forgot her, she now finds that she doesn't want to. She says that she doesn't want to get back together with him (and can't anyway), but she does tell him not to do anything with Noriko .",
