Stepping into the living room, Ami starts to freak out about her idol coming to visit her. The three girls quickly move to the living room, and Niki makes Sensei run out to get snacks for them. As he's away, the three of them discuss how they view Sensei, and also Niki's desire for Ami to rely on her and Noriko as if they're family. Sensei returns home to an ecstatic Ami, who Niki ushers away to try on the clothes she brought.",
