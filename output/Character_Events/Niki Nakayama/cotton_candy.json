At the diner, Niki is worried about being recognised, and when Sensei suggests that this is unlikely, she bets him that the waitress will know who she is. The waitress is Kaori , who doesn't. Niki tells Sensei that although their relationship is obviously over, she would like to keep in touch with him â€” however, being seen with him could derail her career, so caution will be required. She also wants a real apology sometime, and still doesn't believe his \"amnesia\" story.",
