        "synopsis": "Dragging him by the arm, Niki takes Sensei deeper into the woods, showing him the sights of their past. The first stop is a clearing in the woods, where the two of them once built a base made of garbage and pretend to be secret agents. She remarks it was pointless, ultimately, but that she wished it would have lasted longer. The second stop is a tree near a clearing, one where they'd carved their names into a tree. Niki confesses she went back and scribbled his name out after they broke up, but offers to find a new tree for them to use. Staring at the tree, Sensei's mind fails to make sense of the feelings overwhelming him, but slowly pieces together some memories. Along with familiar sensations, the memory of someone he wants to forget forces its way back - He asks to be taken somewhere else. The two of them go to a number of places, all of which slowly help Sensei piece together his past - A convenience store they'd shop at, a bus stop they'd wait at, a restaurant they always talked about eating at, a softball field, the pool, a neighbor's house. This flow of memories comes to a screeching halt when they arrive at their last destination, a place that Sensei's mind refuses to even acknowledge exists. He panics, afraid of having let himself get carried away, but as he stares longer and longer at the destination ahead, the memory returns. At last, he faces the place where his brother and his brother's wife died. Too overwhelmed to speak, Niki does it for him. She reminds him that, if he truly wants to move forward, he'll need to acknowledge both the good and bad memories, but promises him she'll be with him every step of the way. Sensei struggles to understand why she'd do that and struggles even more to believe her but allows himself to be led away to another place. Calling him by his real name, Niki guides him \"back home\".",
