        "synopsis": "Having been guided to the Nakayama family's home , Sensei takes a seat on Niki 's old bed as she goes to make tea. He takes in his surroundings, and ruminates on all the memories he's had returned, the most striking of which being his name. The thought of having one makes him uneasy, feeling it's too valuable an object for him to have. His mind wanders. He senses the mood, and understands the implication of being home alone with her, but wonders if it's right of him to go with the flow; He's never loved anyone in the way such sentimentality deserves. The memory he tried to ignore earlier forces itself back in, and reminds him that he at least loved her that way. The memory, Sekai, calls out for him, asking him to reach out and touch her to prove she's more than just \"a memory\". He tries to ignore her, but after she misquotes Shakespeare, he's baited into correcting her and as consequence acknowledging her. HIs mind wanders. He senses the mood between him and Niki, and understands the implication of being home alone with her, but questions if it's okay to go along. He feels she deserves a more genuine love, and it's one he's never experienced before. An apparition, Sekai, reminds him that they love each other that way. It calls out to him, asking him to reach out and prove she's not \"just a memory\". He tries to ignore her, but after she misquotes Shakespeare, he's baited into correcting and, by consequence, acknowledging her. The memory disappears as Niki steps back into her room, taking a seat next to Sensei as he mindlessly watches TV. Seeing that he's started to spiral into self-deprecation, she goes through a series of quips, even temporarily putting on her idol persona to try and cheer him up. He asks her to stop, saying he prefers her real personality most. Caught off-guard by the genuine compliment, she scoots closer to him, offering to spend the night together. Sensei believes she'll regret it, that the day should be special, not miserable. Niki disagrees - The day was special. Not only did they tour their past, but he confronted something he's spent almost the last decade running from. She reaffirms her promise to stay with him forever, and the two spend the night together.",
