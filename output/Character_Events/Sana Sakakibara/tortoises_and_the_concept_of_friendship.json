When she misinterprets some of Sensei's jokes, he says that while Rin has been doing a good job of \"coaxing her out of her shell\", there's still a ways to go. Sana says that she likes her shell, and that tortoises get along just fine, but says that she'll still keep trying to become more social. Sensei keeps watching movies with Sana until she falls asleep on him.",
