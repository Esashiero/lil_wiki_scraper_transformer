        "synopsis": "At night, Sensei finds Sana sitting under a palm tree and joins her. After a few jokes about how this was a secret getaway for both of her and Ayane , Sensei tells her that she should concentrate on their ‘private time’ and promises to respect her unspoken rules, but she can’t remember any and Sensei’s examples don’t ring a bell. He asks her if there’s a reason why she acts so differently today, but she claims that she behaves like her usual self – a girl who’s really happy that he spends time with her, fears that he finds her best friend and mother more appealing than her and, like the other girls, wants his attention and affection. Sensei tells her that this doesn’t sound like the Sana he learned about over almost six semesters. When she offers to teach him more about her, he points out that she didn’t question how they already had multiple semesters together and demands to know who she is. After one last attempt to convince him, ‘Sana’ reveals her true identity as the girl with the daisy. Sensei can vaguely remember her, which comes to her surprise since his memories of her should’ve been erased. While she praises her impersonation skills, Sensei tells her that she was still off and that he would appreciate it if she didn’t take over his students. She corrects him by saying that it was her all along, that he only saw Sana while his mind was convinced that it was her and that the real Sana is somewhere further down the beach. Sensei tries to get some answers from her, but she claims that the rules forbid her from answering. She instead compliments her performance again, but Sensei thinks that she’s still far off both in her behavior and in her feelings towards him, even claiming that they were made up. She tells him that those were Sana’s true feelings that she ‘channeled’ from her. She also tells him that she was only messing with him while he has another one of his blackouts, though she notices that this one is different since he’s both aware of her and able to hold a conversation. She contributes this to him adapting to the insanity, though he wishes for a more useful power like her transformations. She tells him that he already has those as he transforms into different versions of himself on this and different timelines – with him being on one that’s both good and bad. Sensei wonders if he needs to be wary of her impersonating everyone, but she assures him that she rarely does this and usually just copies their outfits. She asks him if knowing Sana’s feelings through her charade changes something, but he doesn’t acknowledges them until Sana herself tells him about them. They talk a little bit more about how the world works for them until Sensei starts to get back to the real world. He asks if he can at least have her name, because he would forget it anyway according to her, and she tells him that he can just name her after his favorite flower.",
