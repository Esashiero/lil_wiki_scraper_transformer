        "synopsis": "Sensei decides to head to the bar and hang out with Sana again, only this time as he steps up to the bar, he finds someone who he quickly deduces is Sana's mother working there instead. The woman bubbly greets him and invites him to sit down, and quickly grabs Sensei his requested beer. After he has it, the woman begins flirting shamelessly with him, which he easily returns, much to her delight. The two talk about the state of the bar for a moment, before the topic diverts to Sana, who Sensei tells her he's doing his best as the teacher to help overcome her social anxiety. The woman, surprised, introduces herself as Sara , and she quickly asks about Sensei's age, and is surprised to find out they're supposedly close in that regard. Sara quickly passes Sensei another flirtatious remark, which he returns with one of his own, and she breaths a sigh of relief, before Sana comes over to the counter, surprised to learn Sensei is at the bar tonight. Sensei is quick to notice through their banter that Sana isn't very good at handling her mother's bubbly and outgoing personality, and Sara quickly tries to pry a story out of Sensei, only for him to politely rebuke the request. Sara quickly moves in on this and decides to secretly slip Sensei her phone number, much to Sana's openly-protested chagrin. During the resulting brief argument, Sana lets something slip that instantly flags to Sara that she has a crush on Sensei, something which Sara mentions offhand a moment later. Sara decides that she'll also trust Sensei with her well-being, and after a few more drinks and a bunch of conversation, Sensei decides to call it a night and head home to get some rest.",
