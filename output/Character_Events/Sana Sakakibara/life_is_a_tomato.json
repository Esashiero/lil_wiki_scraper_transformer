She says that her mother has been \"really annoying\" since Sensei started coming around, and has been asking her questions about him. Since Sana doesn't actually know that much about him, they decide to take turns answering questions about each other. Maki overhears and joins them — Sana knows her as her mother's friend, but doesn't know her as Makoto 's mother. Sana's first question is about Sensei's outlook on life — he tells her that life resembles a tomato, because although it outwardly looks fine, you'll sometimes bite into a rotten one, and can't tell in advance when that will happen.",
