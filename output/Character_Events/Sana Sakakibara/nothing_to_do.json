        "synopsis": "Sensei arrives in the dorm hallway to find Sana standing in front of her dorm room. When he questions Sana on why she isn't in her room, she just says she felt like she had to be outside. When Sensei asks if they can chat, she says she's okay with that, since she's supposed to be studying but doesn't really feel like it, and that she has nothing else to do since her mom is handling the bar for the evening. The question diverts to Sana's mother, who Sensei learns a bit more about upon request, but Sana is rather vague, saying Sensei should find out for himself when the two eventually cross paths, and the topic again changes, this time to how Sana is enjoying living in her dorm with Ayane . She talks about Ayane briefly, before Sensei notices the conversation is beginning to wear on Sana's already fragile nervousness, and excuses himself to head home for the night.",
