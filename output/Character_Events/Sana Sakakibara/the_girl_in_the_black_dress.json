They are interrupted by a strange girl who talks about the end of days, and how they are not prepared for what is to come. She asks Sensei if he believes in god GOD GoD God, and whether what awaits him at the end of the world is wonderful or sad. She tells Sensei that although he cannot find his way home, he will soon reach for salvation, and she will be there to catch him. She is envious that Sensei has \"seen God\", when she herself has only spoken with him. Before leaving, she tells Sana that \"he is happy now\". Sana is left shaken by the encounter, despite Sensei advising her to just ignore it.",
