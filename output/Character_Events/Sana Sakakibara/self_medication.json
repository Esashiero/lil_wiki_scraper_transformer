Sana has been thinking about their encounter with a strange girl while out walking, particularly the girl's statement that \"he is happy now\". Sana reminds Sensei that she had a brother. Sespite thinking that the strange girl's words are probably nonsense, Sana still can't help wondering if the girl somehow knew something. After Sana decides to change the topic, Sensei notes again how much she dislikes the idea of Sensei getting together with her mother. Sana continues to self-medicate until she falls asleep.",
