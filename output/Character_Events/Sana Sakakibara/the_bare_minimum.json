        "synopsis": "Sensei arrives at the bar to have a drink, but is surprised to find that no one is in the bar at all, aside from Sana , who approaches and greets him. He asks her why the bar is dead, and she replies by saying the bar is almost always dead, and asks to sit with Sensei, which he ultimately agrees to. Sensei remains silent as he 'begins' the lesson, waiting to see what Sana will do, but when she doesn't reply, he's forced to take charge of the conversation. Sana remains immensely nervous as she explains that she hasn't had the best of luck in regard to opening up lately, and Sensei decides she needs to be thrown to the wolves to learn better, so to speak, and has her go behind the counter while he plays the role of a difficult customer. He demands a beer and a plate of spaghetti, which throws Sana for a massive loop, something he realizes when she starts crying mere seconds after the beginning of the act. Sensei immediately calls a halt to proceedings, giving Sana some critical advice on the restaurant and customer service industries, before he and Sana leave and go their respective ways for the night.",
