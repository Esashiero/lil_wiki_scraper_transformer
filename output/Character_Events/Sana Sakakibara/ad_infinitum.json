        "synopsis": "Having calmed herself down but still feeling uneasy, Sana calls her mom to ask if she can sleep over for the night. Sara immediately accepts and offers to meet her halfway or send someone to pick her up, but Sana declines, wanting to get some fresh air by herself. Sara's a bit worried and thinks she should stay on the phone, but Sana reassures her she'll be fine and begins making her way over. While on her way, Sana encounters a variety of strange sights, sounds, and unexplainable phenomena. She struggles through it all, telling herself it's nothing but a dream. It's not the first time she's encountered things like this, but it's the most affecting experience yet. The walk is a reminder that the way the world is depends on the angle you view it — Even places like Kumon-Mi can appear entirely different from person to person. Sana, with some help, arrives at her mother's place, disoriented and confused. Worried about her muddled expression, Sara tries to pry an explanation out of her daughter. Sana's unable to give on, stumbling on her words before asking if Sara \"still sees things\". Upon hearing this, Sara immediately becomes concerned, asking for clarification Sana can't give. Sara grabs Sana by her shoulders and tells her to remember that whatever she thinks she saw was just \"in her head\". When Sana reluctantly agrees, Sara pulls her into a close hug, happy her daughter is safe.",
