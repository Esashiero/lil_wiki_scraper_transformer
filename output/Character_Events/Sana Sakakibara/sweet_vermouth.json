        "synopsis": "Sensei decides to visit the bar, but Sana informs him that she doesn't have time for him since she needs to teach Yuki , their new employee. Sana asks Sensei to order something to test Yuki, but she acts rude towards him, claiming Sara recommended her to use her \"rough exterior\" to appeal to customers, and doesn't know how to make the drink he ordered. Sana teaches her how to make multiple drinks, though Sensei can tell that she won't remember them, and he is impressed by Sana being so knowledgeable on so many drinks. An hour of teaching later, Yuki ends her shift, and Sana and Sensei take a seat at a table in the bar. He is still surprised that she managed to deal with Yuki so easily, and Sana says that her wearing a barmaid uniform made interacting with her less scary. He compliments her progress, with her adding how she was able to enjoy the last sleepover at his house without Ayane . He seconds this, until he remembers that the last reset erased the sleepover and how he found both of them at the dorm . He asks her about it, but she remembers everything that happened duringthe sleepover and finds it weird that Ayane doesn't know about it. She moves on from this and wants to tell him something, which he's fine with, claiming that time is weird sometimes. She agrees with him, feeling that time passes quickly yet they experienced a lot, which allowed her to step out of her comfort zone and do things she was too scared to do before. She's proud of how many friends she's made already, but Sensei reminds her that he expects her to befriend everyone , something she now thinks is possible. Sensei says he's proud of her, though expected her to lean more on him for support, which she finds funny since she thought she was leaning too much on him and Ayane. She also asks to lean on him again when she has to face more challenging activities, and he agrees if she can manage to get his attention when all the other girls are seeking it too. He also claims that she need to do this if she doesn't wants to fall into complacency, but she thought he does live his life like this, making her wonder if he found something he wants. Both fall silent, and Sensei thinks about her question, realizing that there are things he wants, but since they're unclear to him, he pretends like they don't exist. He leaves the bar shortly after.",
