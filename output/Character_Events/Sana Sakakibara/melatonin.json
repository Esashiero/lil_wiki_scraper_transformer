        "synopsis": "Sensei arrives at the bar as Sana cleans the counter after a relatively busy night, still surprised that hiring Yuki and handing out fliers could improve their business that easily. Sana tells him that new customers came and were understanding when they couldn't get certain drinks yet. She hopes that the increase in business motivates her mother to buy a bigger selection of liquor to increase their menu. Sensei wonders if she could afford it as she comes out of the back room together with Yuki. Due to their first profitable business night after a long time, she invites everyone to a celebratory meal at Tojo Ramen. Since it's in the old district and they will ride Yuki's motorcycle, Sensei declines, and Sana decides to stay behind to close up the bar. Sara puts Sana into Sensei's care and claims that taking care of her would train him for the time when they're married. This annoys him since every mother tries to turn him into their daughter's new father, which triggers Yuki since she doesn't have any intention to do that. Sara cuts their conversation short and leaves the bar with Yuki, making Sensei feel uncomfortable being alone with Sana after learning more about her brother . Sensei offers to walk her back to the dorm but realizes that, considering how her brother died, this might not be the best idea. He brushes it off, though, since they already did that without any problems . She agrees but wants to borrow some Rom-Coms from her mother for Ayane and runs to her mother's bedroom to get them. After ten minutes of waiting, Sensei wonders why Sana isn't back yet and decides to follow her upstairs. Once he reaches Sara's bedroom, he finds her frozen in place and staring at a disturbing object on the bed. He offers to put it away, but she doesn't want him to touch her mother's belongings and decides to do it herself. She closes her eyes and, with some support from him, manages to put it away. As she tries to calm down, she finds something else on the shelf. Sensei comes closer to take a look and sees her holding a contraceptive. Sana wants to know why her mother has them, but Sensei has no idea. She confronts him with them, assuming that these are his and that Sara's flirting isn't just harmless fun. While he does have a deeper relationship with Sara, Sensei doesn't find it justified to be called out for something he hasn't done, and tries his best to calm her down and to convince her to talk with Sara. It doesn't work since Sana assumes that asking her for an explanation would result in her telling her a convenient lie. Furthermore, she already suspected that both of them had a more intimate relationship, especially after he found her bedroom without any issues. He explains that he carried Sara into her bedroom once when she passed out, but she isn't buying it. Sana always feared that he would get tot close to her mother, but when Sensei asks what it is she fears, she falls silent. She makes him promise that he told her the truth, to keep everyone at arm's length if he lied to her and to stay away from Sara. After Sana calmed down, they leave the bar and Sensei is glad that he managed to resolve that confrontation without having to lie to her.",
