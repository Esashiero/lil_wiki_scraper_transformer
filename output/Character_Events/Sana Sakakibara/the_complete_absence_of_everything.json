She thinks that some of what Yasu says is \"actually kind of interesting\", and although she isn't religious, she thinks that it's important to talk to people who have different views. However, she doesn't want to discuss what Yasu said the first time they saw her, and changes the subject. They talk about Sensei's own views on religion, about wishing for there to be something after death, and about what dying does to the people who are left behind. Sensei becomes philosophical and remembers something, but things are returned to the way they are meant to be and he goes home.",
