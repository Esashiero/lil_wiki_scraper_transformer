        "synopsis": "Wanting to check in on Touka , Sensei decides to spend his morning at the archery range. Upon arriving though, he finds Wakana and Tsubasa talking amongst themselves. Joining them he finds the two to be on familiar terms already, with Tsubasa revealing they're both alumni of the same private school, though not former classmates due to the gap in ages. After some bantering between Wakana and Sensei, Tsubasa, on her way out, invites the two out with her for the afternoon. Wakana declines, having to return to her duty as kyudo club advisor, but Sensei accepts, and the two begin to take a stroll around the premises. Having spoken to her daughter, Tsubasa tells Sensei the only thing left to execute their plan is for him to push Chika in the right direction. Still feeling hesitant about the idea, Sensei pushes back, saying it feels odd for him to try and uproot her life just because the two of them think it's better for her. Tsubasa disagrees, saying most people aren't smart enough to make their own decisions and that in Chika's case, she's risking two lives instead of just her own by refusing her offer. Still, not on board, Sensei argues that Chika needs to fail on her own if she wants to improve and that providing the illusion of free will isn't giving Chika the credit she deserves. While Tsubasa agrees with this in general, she continues to disagree with this in Chika’s case, and since she sees no problem as long as nothing crashes and burns, she gives him the choice between believing in the intelligence of his students or her good intentions. Now having a more solid grasp of Tsubasa's personality, Sensei questions why she'd ever let Touka into his class if she's so controlling. Tsubasa clarifies that Touka's autonomy is not as real as Sensei thinks it is, but that she allows her to attend Kumon-mi High so that she makes mistakes she’s supposed to make – However, she would never put her daughter into a position that she cannot succeed in. Having said so much about herself, Tsubasa tries to pry information out of Sensei, asking him a barrage of questions that he entirely deflects, feeling he has little that's interesting about him. Tsubasa accepts this answer, though does say she'll look into his past on her own time later. While Sensei is intimidated by her intent, she assures him that she has no ill will towards him and is only interested to know more about the man who has and will become an important part for everyone in her family. Sensei escorts Tsubasa back to her car, ruminating over if her self-centered interpretation of good will break once faced with reality and if she’s able to change with the world she assumes she controls. While he has no answer yet, he doesn’t mind dancing to her tune a bit longer if it allows him to change that.",
