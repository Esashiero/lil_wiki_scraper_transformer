        "synopsis": "Sensei knocks on door to Room 6, and while he doesn't receive a response, he can hear something on the other side. He decides to enter and see what's going on, only to find Molly relaxing to something on her screen. He's not surprised to find her like this, but is surprised to see what's currently on her screen, knowing he has to pretend not to have seen anything. Once she's done, he approaches her to inform her of his presence, only for her to freak out, fall out of her chair and kick him in the face by accident. While recovering from the fall, she asks him to give her some time to change into her casual clothes, and he leaves her room to wait for her. After getting up, Molly curses her luck before following him, still having her browser tab open, showing a picture of Rin . In the hallway, Molly begs him to keep what he saw a secret, especially to Rin, but once he acknowledges that he shouldn't have entered her room without permission, she gets angry, tries to rationalize what happened in her own way and intends to use a magical lock from now on, though Sensei recommends to just make sure she locked the door properly. She's still upset about what happened, and while he suggests to let it go, she can't, because while she can ignore what he saw her do, she can't ignore what he saw on her screen. He tries to move on, but while Molly tries to downplay it, her emotions get the better of her and she confesses her feelings for Rin, how she's hurt that Rin doesn't see her that way and how she ignored her after what happened on Christmas only to pretend that nothing happened a week later. After getting this off her chest, she tries to boast how she's above romance, only to end up on the verge of tears and crying into Sensei's chest once he offers her a hug. While consoling her, he acknowledges how a weird night turns into an emotional moment only by forcing himself into something he shouldn't have. After she calmed down and went back into her room, he thinks how being identical in personality and interests don't help some people to become a couple and how both girls – and everyone else for that matter – have to figure their feelings out for themselves, while he can only watch and offer support when needed.",
