Molly admits that she has been losing sleep lately, and that she has been throwing herself into gaming to try to distract herself. She says that the worst part isn't that Rin is with someone else, or that Molly's relationship with Rin will take time to recover — it's the embarrassment. She says for now, she deserves to feel down, but if she ignores her feelings, time will eventually make things better. Molly gets Sensei to help her close up the cafe and walk her back to the dorms, with a stop on the way.",
