She tells Sensei that their meeting is a gift from the Heavens above or the Hells below, and when Sensei asks what happens if he doesn't believe in those, Molly tells him to find something to believe in. She suggests herself, because \"cute girls are more powerful than God\". They discuss the merits of her cult, and religion in general, until she is called away by a gaming commitment.",
