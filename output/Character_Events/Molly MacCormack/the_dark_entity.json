Molly then brings up a more serious subject â€” \"the right thing to do when you find out that someone you care about is hurting themself\". Molly reveals that her mother killed herself, making Molly very aware of things like that. Sensei guesses that the person Molly is talking about is Rin , and assures Molly that he's working on the problem.",
