She says that real life lacks the clear progression systems and score checks of games, and that you \"gotta actually think about stuff\". Rather than put much effort into moving through life, she prefers a policy of \"just standing still and waiting for everything to pass by you\", which she says gets you to the same place in the end. However, she says that she is happy to have ended up in Sensei's class.",
