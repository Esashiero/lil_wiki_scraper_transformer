        "synopsis": "With their plans finished, Sensei and Molly board the subway and ride it back to the center of Kumon-mi. Molly's a bit surprised to find the rush hour so busy, having assumed the depiction in anime to be an exaggeration. Sensei commends her ability to assimilate into Japanese life despite the gigantic difference between Irish and Japanese culture. He does, though, wonder why she chose a place like Kumon-mi instead of Tokyo, where foreigners would be more easily accommodated. She responds that it would've been too easy, and going somewhere more out of the way allowed her to challenge herself more. Their conversation is abruptly cut off when a sudden shuffle of passengers forces the two of them to be uncomfortably squished together. The two stand around, awkwardly keeping silent until the train reaches a stop. The two of them step off the train to take a break from the rough commute. As Molly walks away to use the bathroom, Wakana and Osako unexpectedly show up, the former asking Sensei if any of his students still want to submit something for the school's poetry contest which will take place after the upcoming standardized tests. She’s also looking forward to his entry, but he doesn’t know if he can submit anything. Wakana reminds him that he is bound by a dare to do so, but Sensei isn’t confident in his ability to put his feelings into words anymore, yet promises to at least try to write something for the contest. Molly returns soon after, and the two make their way home.",
