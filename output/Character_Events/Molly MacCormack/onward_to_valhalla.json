Sensei says that although she's very different from him, he's still happy that she's here, and that he's impressed at how well she's doing. Molly wonders if she's on his love route, but he says not. She points out that there is a way in which they aren't so different â€” their \"unearthly desire to be lazy\" at their respective jobs (which is why she's sitting outside rather than working).",
