Molly wants to get changed, and bribes Sensei into not looking with pictures of girls in their Halloween costumes. Rin is one of those girls, and this raises the topic of their friendship. Sensei tells her that it can be probably be repaired, and although Molly isn't sure about it, Sensei suggests going to talk to Rin. She eventually agrees, provided Sensei goes with her.",
