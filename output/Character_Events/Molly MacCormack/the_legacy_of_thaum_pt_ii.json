He chooses to watch with Tsuneyo again rather than play. Haruka isn't there, or she might have something to say about Molly running a game in her cafe. After watching for a while, Sensei decides to head off â€” Molly is a bit upset that he wasn't having fun, but he assures her that it's just a matter of different people liking different things.",
