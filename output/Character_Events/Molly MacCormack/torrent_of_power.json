She shows him her anime figures, which leads to a discussion her interest in Japanese culture and her hobbies â€” she is part of the manga club with Ami and Rin . Despite her proficiency with Japanese, she says that she has sometimes felt that people look at her \"a little weird\". Molly is also interested in cosplay, and demonstrates a pose, speech, and staff, but isn't yet prepared to wear the actual costume for him. She also mentions the possibility of getting Tsuneyo and Ami to cosplay, and offers to sell him pictures.",
