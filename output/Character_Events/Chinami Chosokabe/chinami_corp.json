He heads over to the Chosokabe flat, where Chinami blackmails him into telling her a story about a \"little girl who grows up to be the CEO of Chinami-corp, the biggest Japanese dealer of cute animals\". She has a lot of opinions about the plausibility of the story Sensei tells, but doesn't get to hear its conclusion â€” Yumi comes back and throws Sensei out.",
