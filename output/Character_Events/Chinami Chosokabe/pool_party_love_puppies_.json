Yumi is not pleased to be found in the kiddie pool with Chinami, and leaves â€” Chika goes after her. After talking about puppies for a bit, Chinami explains that the pool party is being held because Chinami won't be able to go to the beach with everyone else. She has been looking up information on her condition, although Sensei tries to tell her not to rely on it. They talk about Chinami's future life until Chika gets back.",
