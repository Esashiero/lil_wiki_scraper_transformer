        "synopsis": "Despite having some problems with his mental state, Sensei visits the mall intending to get a reward from Chika for taking care of her sister and the Tsukioka’s . He finds her near the changing room of her workplace where she waits for Chinami to change into her new clothes. Sensei tells her why he’s here, but Chika doesn’t want to do it in earshot of her sister, but offers to give him a reward later since she’s also in the mood. Unbeknownst to her, Chinami stands behind her and, once she makes her presence known, just manages to safe herself before she gets too explicit. She notices that Chinami isn’t wearing her helmet, which she doesn’t want to wear because it’s too hot, but she forces her to go back and put it on due to her weak immune system. While she’s gone, Chika wants to know why her sister knows what an affair is, because she said it when Sensei mentioned coming with Yumi and that Touka has one with everyone in town, and he blames it on Touka. Chinami returns with her helmet on and Chika decides to take her break and treat Chinami and Sensei for lunch. Sensei reminds her that he would have something else instead, but she promises that he gets it when they’re alone. They find a place at the food court and Chinami is unable to drink her milk. Chika tells her to wait until they’re back in the office and promises that she will try to find a mask for her. Sensei’s hallucinations seem to get worse and Chika notices that something is off with him and decides to bring him water while getting their order. Sensei thinks that she could do something else instead, but gets caught in a loop where she asks if this would really help and his dark thoughts are replaced by a simple yes. When he breaks out, Chika is gone and Chinami tells him that he wasn’t saying anything. Chinami takes her helmet off, much to Sensei’s shock, and explains that she can’t endure the heat anymore and that it’s fine since no one’s around, though she speaks normally rather than in her usual style, but Sensei decides to look past it when she barks again and allows her to keep it off as long as Chika isn’t looking at them. He wonders why she hates wearing her helmet when she usually likes it and she tells him that, according to the news, it’s the hottest summer yet and the helmet isn’t suited for this climate. When she starts talking with her helmet, he hopes that Chika returns soon so she has to wear it again, but, even though she knows why she has to, she doesn’t want to because she can’t see anything in it and wants to see more things before she dies. Sensei thinks that it’s too early for her to worry about that since her immune system will get stronger, buts he asks him what she does if this never happens and she’ll always be weak, but before she can go deeper, Chika returns, forcing her to put her helmet on. Chika is proud of her sister for listening to her and brings her into the office, but Sensei hears a cough when she passes the loudspeaker.",
