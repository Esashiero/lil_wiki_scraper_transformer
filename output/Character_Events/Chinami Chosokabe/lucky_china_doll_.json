        "synopsis": "Chika briefly walks back in , having accidentally left already dressed for work. She changes back, says her goodbyes for real this time, and leaves Sensei and Chinami to sit around in silence. With nothing to distract him, Sensei's mind wanders, pondering how depressing the past day has been – He's now spent time with two families who are all too willing to invite him into their dynamic permanently, all whilst his actual family remains sidelined . He is unable to determine the reason behind his hesitation, simply accepting that making the worst possible choices is part of who he is. It is this string of bad decision-making that's landed him here, after all, supervising someone with way too much trust in him and unaware that she might be in danger if he happens to ”black out” again . He's snapped out of these thoughts by Chinami barking, having apparently done so for fun. She likens the feeling to real dogs, who supposedly bark if they see dead people, asking Sensei if he believes in ghosts. He says he does . This surprises her, having thought Sensei would cynically dismiss the idea and lecture her about imagination being stupid. He corrects her, stating imagination is harmful , distracting oneself from reality with no real benefits other than curing boredom. He apologizes once she points out that he seems to be in a foul mood all of a sudden. She insists it's alright, willing to accept him regardless of how he feels or who he is, though she might feel like this purely out of loneliness, because, as of late, Chinami's seen less of both her sister and Yumi – Additionally, she states Tsukasa and her are too different for her to feel comfortable around. He asks her if both of them aren't too different as well, but Chinami negates this, pointing out that they're both kind and care a lot about Chika. Sensei denies this, claiming to not care about Chika properly, with his current feelings for her being much less genuine. He adds that he understands this is wrong of him, but he can't truly commit to betterment because he's an idiot. Hearing this, Chinami wonders if her being homeschooled is a good thing, and he thinks it is due to her being safer here, which she's glad to hear since she wants to be smart enough to talk with him. Chinami is left conflicted by this, concluding that Sensei's hesitance to accept how similar they are is due to how reluctant he is to accept happiness, which is one of the things she apparently overheard Chika say during his absence. Additionally, Yumi believes he hates himself, something Chinami contributes to his struggle on how to love those around him properly, and he admits it's part of his problems. She hopes to understand the other parts more easily, and he promises she will when she's older and smarter. She hopes he'll still be around when this time comes, having feared his recent absence meant he'd disappear forever. He's unable to outright deny this possibility, plunging the two into silence as they both try to understand the weight behind it. Chinami ends up speaking first, telling Sensei that disappearing again is a bad idea which will only create more misery as her sister self-denigrates. He understands this but informs her that someone else he cares about currently needs him and that their misery manifests as misery for everyone else. He adds that Chika doesn't need him, as she's far more independent and successful than he'll ever be. Chinami questions why this makes it okay to hurt her feelings – He answers that it doesn't, but that hurt is inevitable in all relationships. She tells him that running away like he's suggesting won't solve anything, as Chika's far more loyal and caring than he's giving her credit for; If he wants to disappear from her life, he needs to tell her that directly. Sensei attempts to backpedal, claiming that he wasn't planning on it soon, but adding that \"running away\" is part of how he has to live if he doesn't want the \"ghost\" which lurks behind him to catch up. Silence returns between the two, but rather than being formed out of confusion, Sensei can tell this one is laced with concern. Not just concern for the uprooting of her life or the damnation of a future she's spent time imagining, but rather for who will continue to love Chika in her stead. Chinami beckons Sensei over to her mother 's altar, grabbing her photo and making him say hello. She teases him for greeting a photo but grimly notes that she'll be a photo too someday. Her favorite part of this new home is that they can have a proper altar to pay her respects. She hopes her mother, wherever she is, doesn't blame herself for Chinami's weak body. If anything, it makes the fact Chika grew up strong and healthy all the more impressive, making it supremely important for her to live happily as Chinami never will. Sensei tries to reason with her, but Chinami refuses to listen, reaffirming that she'll be gone someday whether she likes it or not. There are so many things in life she'd love to experience, but simply can't, putting on a brave face and accepting these hardships in hopes that her positive attitude will keep her sister afloat. But all things end eventually and when it comes time for Chinami to join her mother, she really hopes Sensei will take her place. Even if he can't learn to like himself, she reminds him that should he need to run again, he can always have Chika back him up. Sensei is left speechless in the wake of these emotions. Chinami, having started to cry, wipes her tears away and jokingly blames Sensei for causing them. He accepts this, as he's never claimed to be good at babysitting. She suggests he try tutoring instead. He turns this idea down immediately, prompting some awkward fumbling as Chinami reveals she's invited Tsukasa over before he arrived, having assumed he'd accept. Someone knocks at their door, and Chinami asks Sensei to follow her so they can greet Tsukasa.",
