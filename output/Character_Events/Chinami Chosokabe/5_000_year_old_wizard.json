Chinami wants Sensei to marry Chika so that he'll be around more, and claims that Chika talks about having a baby with Sensei. When it's pointed out that marrying Chika wouldn't make him Chinami's daddy, Chinami starts talking to a picture of her late mother, trying to persuade her to marry Sensei. Sensei is uncomfortable, but puts up with it until it's time to go.",
