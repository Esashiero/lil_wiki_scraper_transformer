Wakana says that the most satisfying part of teaching is the sense of having had an impact, but for some reason, it now feels as though the payoff is never actually arriving. Sensei wonders if this is a consequence of the time loops. They also talk about poetry â€” she doesn't think much of Sensei quoting Frost, and herself quotes Poe and Byron.",
