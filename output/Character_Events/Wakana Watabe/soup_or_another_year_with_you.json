Wakana explains that she wants to do something for Osako since it's their anniversary, but Wakana is a terrible cook. Unfortunately, so is Sensei. Osako is surprised to see Sensei when she gets back, but appreciates Wakana's attempt. The soup is inedible, but Osako says that she will get some ingredients for a second cooking attempt, and suggests that Sensei accompany her to the store.",
