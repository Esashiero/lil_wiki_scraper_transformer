Nodoka has been writing erotic short stories about herself and Sensei, and says that they should learn more about each other. She takes him over to her side of the room, pretends that the others can't hear them, and questions him about his motivations — the others think that Nodoka is being weird. After Sensei breaks off the conversation, Futaba asks if Nodoka is feeling okay, and Nodoka says that she was just testing to see if Sensei is harmless (which he is). Otoha asks Sensei to come and help her carry some things.",
