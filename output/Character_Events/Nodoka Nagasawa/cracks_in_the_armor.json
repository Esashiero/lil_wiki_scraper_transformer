Nodoka apologizes for making Sensei feel uncomfortable with her previous grilling , but says that she really did want to press him on his intentions, and on whether he is leading Futaba on. He says that he could have honestly proclaimed his intent to hook up with everyone then, but understands why he didn't. She says that he lost Nodoka Points by not staying to eat pizza and say goodbye properly, which left her with a \"cliffhanger\". However, she says that he is still on her good side, and gives him her phone number.",
