        "synopsis": "Makoto takes a shower after club practice, until Nodoka starts hugging her from behind, which she seems to do with everyone. Nodoka blames the scent of her shampoo and Makoto wonders if she has to change something she uses on a regular basis. She recommends her to just accept her one-sided love and give into her flustered state, but Makoto has no intention to do that and already adapted she will be groped by her. Makoto points out that not every girl is interested in other girls, but Nodoka can’t accept that. She tells her that the shower heads are excellent for some alone time, but thinks that Makoto doesn’t need it when she already has someone. Makoto denies that this is the case, but Nodoka doesn’t believe that Sensei and she have an innocent relationship and wants details. She still denies everything while Nodoka whispers into her ear how good some things would feel, how she won’t tell anyone and only wants to capitalize on it. She asks what she means by that and, in response, Nodoka starts massaging her body and states how envious she is of her figure. Makoto worries that she wants to blackmail her, but she assures her that she likes her too much to do that. Her hand makes its way to Makoto’s lower body and she tries to get more details out of her, but Makoto has enough and stops her. Makoto tells her that she was fine with being groped by her, but what she does now is going way too far. She apologizes and wants to know if she would be into her if she was a man, but realizes that she’s attracted to Sensei for being older. She wonders if she developed that while being abused by Sensei, but she says that he doesn’t abuse her, just has no idea what she needs sometimes. Nodoka thanks her for all the information she gave her and offers to wash her hair, which she agrees to. While Nodoka washes Makoto’s hair, she wants to know why she fell for him. She gives her a summary of how her feelings for him developed over the year but insists that this is a hypothetical scenario. Makoto wants to know how Nodoka sees him and she tells him that he is like a father who gives special attention to her friends. Miku enters their stall and lets them know that they want to go to a restaurant. Makoto assures her that she will be there shortly, while Nodoka has something else to do. She passes by Yumi and wants to know if she has any plans tonight. She doesn’t have any and tells her to piss of, which she does. When Yumi gets back to her locker, she sees that her clothes are missing.",
