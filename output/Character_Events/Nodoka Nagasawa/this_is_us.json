        "synopsis": "The group steps off the train , walking the rest of the way to the venue. Upon arriving, Sensei is surprised to find both the venue and the amassed crowd to be far above his expectations. Nodoka is soon pulled away by the staff and the remaining three take their place among the sea of people. As they wait for Nodoka to step on stage, Sensei notes the inordinate amount of attention people are giving him, slowly becoming more and more uncomfortable. An announcer soon steps up on stage, breaking him free of his anxiety, and formally beginning the panel. Nodoka steps on stage, waits for the crowd's cheers to dissipate, and begins her introduction. Opting to skip the usual PR talk, she immediately jumps into the Q&A portion of her panel, scanning the audience for participants. The Q&A continues, with Sensei noting how each proceeding question becomes more and more unsettling. He silently broods to himself, unsure of how to feel about Nodoka using their personal lives as inspiration so blatantly, and equally as unsure as to why the crowd seems to like his character so much. When the crowd starts to disperse, Rika approaches him, having been silently judging him throughout the panel. He assures her that he has no interest in Nodoka's book and takes the opportunity to ask about her living situation , which she confirms is still terrible but might improve soon. She offers to take him out for dinner, but he turns her down, still having plans for later. As she leaves, she hands him her number, telling him to call whenever he likes. Sensei returns to the girls and all of them find shelter in the employee lounge as they wait for the crowds to disperse more. During this, Rin and Otoha both chastise Nodoka for her disregard for their privacy. He opts to remain silent, disturbed but mildly impressed by how close she pays attention to him.",
