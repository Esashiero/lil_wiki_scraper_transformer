        "synopsis": "Nodoka approaches the small group around Sensei as she’s interested to hear about the sky tendrils . He offers her to take Yasu , but Yasu wants to hold onto Sensei and while Nodoka has an idea why that is, he brings the conversation back to the actual topic. Yasu gives her a brief summery, which Nodoka can accept as logical since it’s based on the water cycle. There’s more to it, but Sensei doesn’t want to taint Futaba ’s purity, who’s surprised to hear that she’s still pure. Since her time is up, Sensei dismisses Yasu to her desk and wants to leave, but Nodoka wants his protection as well and chooses to stay Futaba mentions how Nodoka's been treating Makoto . After getting back to their seats, Nodoka gives Sensei a brief summary on what happened and Futaba scolds her for her continued advances on Makoto again, reminding her that not everyone is bisexual or to get her to take her clothes off to make Sensei stay with them. She thinks that Rin would do it for her and remembers that she still has her underwear . Meanwhile, Chika and Noriko have a discussion about the next steps for their club as Yumi comes in. Chika notices that something’s off with her, but Yumi passes by them while Noriko has a bad feeling about her. Yumi makes her way towards Nodoka, who already knows and accepts what will happen now, grabs her by the throat and beats her up in front of the class. While everyone, especially Futaba, watch in shock and try to figure out what caused this, Sensei decides not to interfere. By the time Imani and Tsuneyo are able to restrain her, Yumi managed to knock Nodoka unconscious and to severely injure her. Imani and Tsuneyo are disappointed in Sensei for letting it happen, but before he can explain himself, he gets interrupted by Yumi and Chika, who’s disappointed and scared by her. Yumi only wants to be taken to the principal to get expelled, but Imani thinks that she’ll only be suspended for a very long time, which she accepts as well. While she’s taken away, Otoha and Rin escort Nodoka to the nurse’s office. Sensei asks her if she’s alright, but she assures him that being sandwiched between two lesbians made what she endured worth it. When they’re gone, the rest of the class tries to make sense of what happened and come to the conclusion that Yumi is just someone who likes hurting others and that something like this was just a matter of time. Sensei knows that this isn’t the case, but recognizes that the only people who will believe that are himself and Chika, who retreated to her desk and tries not to hear them. Sensei decides to apologize to Yasu for not believing her, but she tells him that the bad thing she’s afraid of hasn’t happened yet.",
