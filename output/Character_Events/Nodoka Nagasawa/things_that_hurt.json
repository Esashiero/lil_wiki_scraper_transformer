        "synopsis": "Yumi tries her best to do what Nodoka wants from her while she gets ridiculed and belittled by her. She can’t do it anymore after a while and Nodoka switches to the second option without hesitation. While she gets into position, he notices just how tense he is and can’t look Yumi in the eyes. Nodoka starts while Yumi tries to look away. Sensei still can’t make eye contact with her but hears her sobbing as time goes on. After some help from him, the show comes to a close and Nodoka deletes the picture after she gave Yumi her clothes back. Yumi smashes Nodoka’s phone once she confirms the deletion of the picture and promises to kill her the next time she sees her. Sensei tries to reason with her, but falls silent when she gives him a hurt look. She leaves without saying a word as Sensei regrets that stepping on Nodoka’s broken phone didn’t kill him, because he realizes how much he let Yumi down. Nodoka thinks he should be happy being the first man who got closer to her, but he wants to know what the point was in tearing Yumi down when she was already in the process of bettering herself. Nodoka explains that she only has and wants a small number of friends and that she will do anything to protect or, if that isn’t necessary anymore, avenge them, whether they want her to or not. Since she likes him as well, she wonders if he thinks less of her now, but when he can’t answer that, she tells him that this proves that his opinion of her hasn’t changed and further explains that he tried to stop her out of common decency rather than his desire to actually make her stop. She calls it a day, since she has to take a second shower now. Sensei asks her if she isn’t worried about Yumi, but she’s too pleased with what happened, so she doesn’t care for now. Sensei walks her back to the dorm and takes a handful of sleeping pills once he’s back home.",
