Nodoka looks tired, and her conversation is erratic. Sensei wonders if he should call an ambulance, but Nodoka insists that she is \"super fine\" and is now ready for a normal conversation. Sensei still finds the conversation exhausting, and eventually suggests that Nodoka find a mirror. She concedes that she looks like she \"crawled out of a well\", and talks about seeing beauty in horrible things. Eventually, she declares that she has figured something out and sends him away so that she can focus.",
