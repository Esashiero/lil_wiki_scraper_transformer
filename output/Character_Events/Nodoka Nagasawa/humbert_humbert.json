Nodoka says that (like Sensei) she doesn't much talk about love, but acknowledges that she does \"yearn for the taboo\". She points out that Sensei has a lot of \"opportunities\" at his disposal, and recommends that he take them. She finds it strange that Sensei doesn't read much, since Futaba mentioned that he used to be a writer — he says that anything he wrote would come out \"twisted and indiscernible\", although Nodoka doesn't see the problem. Talking about Uta and Ami as maids gets Nodoka excited — she acknowledges that she is easily excited, but says that she is not easily satisfied.",
