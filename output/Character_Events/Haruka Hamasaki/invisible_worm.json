She tells Sensei that she made a stupid decision, and that nothing more should happen between them because she is married. However, she does admit to having no idea when (or whether) she will ever see her husband again, leaving her lonely and with no sex life. Sensei must decide whether to take advantage of her loneliness to begin a sexual relationship, or else maintain \"what little honor\" he has left by just staying friends.",
