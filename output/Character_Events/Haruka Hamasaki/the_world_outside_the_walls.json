So Haruka rings Sensei and asks him to come over, as she has so few people to share the news with. And so, Sensei comes to visit Haruka at her house and has to hear her perception on the current events. In the end, Sensei returns home safe and gets a phone call from Maki, she said she was sorry for the yelling. Sensei asked her not to apologize and agreed to help with improving Makoto 's mental state.",
