When she arrives, the conversation quickly turns to the nature of her relationship with Sensei. Regardless of whether or not they went any further than the first drunken kiss , she feels bad about what she wants and who she is. If she and Sensei have been having sex, she asks to go into Sensei's room and do something to get her mind off everything; if not, Sensei must decide whether to take advantage of her \"meltdown\" to change that, or just stay friends.",
