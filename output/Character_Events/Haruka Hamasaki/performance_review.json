        "synopsis": "Haruka is giving Rin her performance review when Sensei arrives. Rin notices that Sensei and Haruka seem fairly close now, which leads to them talking about Haruka's social life (or lack of it). After Rin leaves, Sensei and Haruka talk about her â€” Sensei thinks that Rin admires Haruka, and Haruka thinks that Rin has feelings for Sensei. Based on what she says, Sensei starts to think that Haruka might be just as bad as him when it comes to lusting after teenage girls, although Haruka says that she would never actually do anything.",

She indicates that there might be more to it then being a fatherly figure. However, if you've been Bad Homie Sensei casually mentions having fingered Chika . She is upset as you mention that."
