When Ami inevitably discovers them, Ami's usual displeasure about someone stealing Sensei is heightened by obvious envy of Haruka's chest. Ami makes a point of being rude to Haruka to prevent her returning, while Haruka calmly returns fire. At the end of the evening, Sensei reflects that at least no one died.",
