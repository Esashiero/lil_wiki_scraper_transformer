        "synopsis": "Deciding today is the perfect day to go, Sensei calls Haruka to make good on her promise of a vacation . After she answers somewhat deliriously, still waking up, he hangs up and quickly calls Maki to inform her to pack her bags. While he sits and waits for one of the two to swing by and pick him up, he tries to remain focused on the idea of relaxing. Haruka shows up a few hours later with Maki, and Sensei enters her car so the three can make their way to the resort. Along the way, Sensei finds it difficult to stay calm, somewhat content by the fact Haruka drives slower than Maki – Though, he wonders if this is because she's been informed about his discomfort in cars. Haruka notices his discomfort as it's revealed he's been tapping his foot anxiously up and down the entire time. Sensei tells her she doesn't need to worry about him, but she negates this by reminding him that they're friends. Ever since the two of them met, Haruka's done plenty of bad and regrettable things, but ever since getting a wake-up call , she's been dedicated to turning things around. While Sensei sees no problem with her previously self-centered life view, Haruka disagrees and wants to make this trip about them instead of her. Sensei's skeptical of the faith she's putting into this, questioning if she really thinks it'll help Maki. Haruka admits it's likely to fail, but that it's a start at the very least. The group arrives at the resort and quickly changes into swimming attire, finding themselves a spot among the various pools. Sensei opts to remain quiet as Haruka begins to try and push Maki into enjoying the vacation. Her various attempts at ego-boosting fail to work, with Maki quipping about how unfocused these attempts seem to be. Instead, Maki pushes this encouragement back at Haruka, trying to goad her into taking advantage of her husband's absence. Becoming uncomfortable, Haruka tries to dismiss these ideas as not being compatible with everyone's relationships, which Maki vehemently disagrees with – She does drop the topic, though, admitting she only pushed Haruka as payback for how nosy she's been today. While Maki remains as skeptical about the trip's effectiveness as she was earlier, she decides to humor Haruka for the rest of their vacation. The two girls shoo away Sensei as they decide to take a midday nap.",
