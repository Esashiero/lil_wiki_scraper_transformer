While Sara is away getting Sensei a drink, Haruka talks about Sensei's decision to accept or turn down sex with Sara. Later, Haruka tells them both that she's going to stay the night with Sara to avoid driving home â€” the three of them spend the evening getting drunk and (apart from Sensei) talking about feelings. Haruka passes out, and Sara eventually goes to bed. When Sensei wakes Haruka, she kisses him, looks horrified, apologises, and hurries upstairs.",
