She says that when her husband was around, a simple thing like sitting around watching TV could \"feel like the most fun you've had in forever\", but now that he's away, it feels depressing to do it alone. They talk about the other people in Haruka's life, including Sensei, Maki , and Rin (whom they discuss sharing). Haruka gets out her phone to text Rin, and when Sensei notes that he doesn't have Rin's phone number, Haruka gives it to him. Haruka asks Rin whether she would ever date her teacher, but Rin's reply \"could mean anything\". Molly also gives her own reply.",

            "Haruka asked about dating Sensei in a group chat with at least Molly and Rin. While Rin was posting an upside-down smile as reply, Molly posted six eggplants and droplets. This is inline with her previously enthusiasm about Sensei."
