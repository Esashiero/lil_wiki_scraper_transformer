        "synopsis": "Sensei gets philosophical and loses track of time. The maid cafe is closed, but he talks to Uta outside (and also Osako , until she gets tired of their teasing). Uta insists on Sensei accompanying her to karaoke, and unsuccessfully tries to get him to sing. When Sensei falls over, Uta ends up on top of him, but she backs away from starting anything. Afterwards, Uta tells Sensei that this was the \"right move for everyone\". Sensei suggests that she should pay attention to what she wants before worrying about how anyone else feels, but Uta flatly rejects that â€” she likes being the sort of person who looks out for others. She takes Sensei's continued interest as a challenge, and is confident in her ability to keep deflecting his advances.",
