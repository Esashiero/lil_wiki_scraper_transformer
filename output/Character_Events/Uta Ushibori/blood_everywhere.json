Uta reiterates that nothing is going to happen between her and Sensei, and changes the subject to Io. Io once said said that Uta \"got better\", but Uta isn't keen on talking about that either, except to say that she doesn't think it's true — she might be \"super happy now\", but still has things to bury if she is going to move on. They talk about Io's crush on Sensei, and about Uta's own past crushes. Uta gives Sensei her phone number.",
