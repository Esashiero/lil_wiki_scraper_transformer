        "synopsis": "Trying to find shelter from the rain, Sensei and Uta end up renting a room in a love hotel. Sensei immediately suggests to use the situation to get closer, but Uta shuts it down since this isn’t the environment she wants to do that, yet begs him to keep a conversation going since the atmosphere makes her uncomfortable. He wonders why she paid for a room in the first place, and she reminds him that he’s broke. Sensei offers to get a refund, but she rather wants to warm herself up. He has an idea how they could do that, but she already knows where this is going and threatens him with her death beam if he speaks it out. Sensei wonders if one of her beams is capable of warming her up, but, unfortunately, she hasn’t mastered any. Sensei asks what they should do instead, and Uta notices the bathroom. She allows him to take a bath, and while he thinks that she should take one first, he is more than willing to accept her idea. Uta additionally offers to become Uta-chan again for a special bath experience, but he already knows that it will be something completely harmless. He wants to know what she has in mind, but she only intends to tell him once he’s in the bathtub. A defeated Sensei makes his way to the bathroom while Uta questions her actions and also begs Sensei to not look in her direction for the next 30 seconds. Sensei prepares his bath and, surprisingly, only looks at Uta once her time limit ended, but she already finished what she intended to do. Uta enters the bath and washes his back while trying her best to make him feel comfortable as Uta-chan, but he asks her to stop acting so he can experience this with the real Uta, which forces her to suppress a scream of excitement. He still feels bad about her still being drenched and thinks she should at least dry herself off, but she assures him that she doesn’t mind being in wet clothes, that she already removed clothes that are the most uncomfortable to wear in a soaked state, and is surprised to hear that he looked away the entire time. She teases him about how he missed a golden opportunity, but he decides to bide his time for now. Uta thinks that they will look back at this fondly as long as he doesn’t run away with Io , which she hopes he doesn’t do, but he considers it since Io seems to be more open to get intimate with him. She finds this amusing, reminds him that not everyone wants the kind of relationship he prefers, especially after knowing him for a short amount of time. He’s aware of that, but is also unable to tell how far someone is willing to go, so Uta advises him to be careful, because taking the next step too early will scare some people he wants to get closer with off. He uses this to ask her what would be too early for her, but before she can answer him, she receives a text message and uses it to end the conversation while pretending it never happened. Once she reads her message, she immediately leaves the hotel room in shock, much to Sensei’s confusion. Sensei finishes his bath and passes the time until the rain stops. When he leaves, he picks up the clothes Uta left behind.",
