        "synopsis": "Sensei taps on his phone, calling Uta in hopes of catching her before she makes it to archery practice. Once she does pick up, and he's adequately wrapped up his internal monologue, he asks her what she's up to. She reveals she's busy getting dressed for practice, throwing a question back, and asking what he needs from her so early. He tells her to stop what she's doing and come hang out with him for the morning. She insists she can't, having to attend practice. Sensei insists she comes to hang out with him instead, though, inviting her over to his place until Ami returns from work. This suggestion causes her to sputter in shock, refusing to even humor the idea. As a counter-offer, he suggests they meet up somewhere in town instead. Uta's initially hesitant about this idea as well, but Sensei's persistence eventually gets her to cave in, especially when he admits he just wants to see her. She, quietly, admits the same, hurriedly ending the call after telling him to meet her at the park. Sensei makes his way over, feeling slightly guilty about pulling her away from practice but ultimately stifling this feeling as he thinks back on last night's dream. He soon arrives at the park, finding Uta dressed up and looking somewhat nervous. After he compliments her on her appearance, she thanks him but tells him to avoid being too weird, as they'd definitely draw attention. As he continues to slide her his usual amount of banter, she becomes increasingly uncomfortable, asking him if it's okay to be hanging out with her when there are so many other people in his life already. His insistence that the others don't matter right now does little to dispel her worries, and she wonders aloud how this situation might look to other people. Realizing his mistake, he decides to reel in on his forwardness, and the two decide to move away to somewhere with fewer people after Uta's awkwardness starts to draw attention. As they sit down atop a bench deep in the park, he admits to himself how wrong he was for pressuring Uta into hanging out with him, especially so soon after she talked about her past with him. Uta breaks him free of these thoughts, and the two begin to talk about her brother. She mentions how similar he and Sensei are, in the sense that both are very perceptive and thoughtful people. Sensei quips that, with how weird she's always acting around him in public, it won't be long before he's able to meet him in jail . Uta quips that won't happen, especially with someone as powerful as Touka as her friend now. In the middle of this conversation, though, something interferes and messes with Sensei's perception. It talks to and taunts him about what he knows and who he is and the whole while he desperately tries to deny it. At some point, Maya appears and, after he refuses to talk about what pains him, asks if it would be easier for him if all of this disappears. He confirms her question, with Maya stating that this was all he had to say. When he's back to normal, he finds himself at the moment before the interference happened and abruptly apologizes to Uta for something unspecified. She misinterprets what he's referring to, accepts, and continues her train of thought. The day goes on normally, but Sensei forgets what he dreamt about last night.",
