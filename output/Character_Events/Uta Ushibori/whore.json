        "synopsis": "Sensei knocks on the door to Room 7. However, neither of the two inhabitants answers, and, following some reflection on the last time he walked into one of the girl's rooms unannounced, he decides to head inside. Once in, he confirms his suspicion that neither girl is home, realizing the freedom that brings. Meanwhile, Uta and Io take a bath at the bathhouse , enjoying the steam and the warm water, so much so that Uta quips everyone needs an Io in their life. Io retorts that her \"friend cap\" has been exceeded and that everyone else will need to find someone else. Anticipating this torrent of negativity, Uta tries to get Io to compliment her efforts instead, failing and leading Io to insult Futaba . Now annoyed, Uta once again tries to get her to stop being so rude, especially to people she's never even spoken to before. Io refuses, citing her refusal to open up makes it harder to be taken advantage of – She'll make an exception for Miku though, since she doesn't feel threatened by her. Io wonders if she has a certain \"type\" with friends, pointing out how similar Uta and Miku are, both being former tomboys with a newly developed feminine streak. Uta points out that, unlike her, Miku is still a tomboy and only broadens her horizon, but Io makes the argument that Uta is still one due to her hobbies and interests, though wishes it would extend to her wardrobe, especially regarding her particularly feminine sleepwear. As the topic trails on, Io realizes the underlying implication in one of her stray comments, and immediately backpedals while apologizing profusely. Uta, having become uncomfortable, assures her it's fine as it saves her from bringing up that topic herself. She confesses that she got another picture the other day, this time from a new number. Hearing this, Io's baffled at how all these people keep sneaking past her phone's parental lock , suggesting Uta stop using phones altogether and just use hers to call her parents. Uta turns this idea down, worrying that all the traffic would simply find its way to her instead. With this photo, Uta's \"total\" for the month climbs up to nine, and the two realize it's time for her to switch to a new one once again. Io laments how disgusting the entire situation is, with Uta apologizing for being part of it in the first place. Io insists that isn't how she meant it, but Uta continues because, to her, she hasn't changed at all – She's still the same disgusting pervert she was when she was younger, and that's all anyone will ever see if they learn about her past . Her entire job is centered around appealing to people, and while she's drowned in praise, it's only because no one knows about the real Uta Ushibori. The thought of all this drives her wild, and she confesses just how sad she truly is. Io, struggling to find the right words, tells Uta that she's wrong – Someday someone will love her for who she is because who she truly is is someone strong and amazing, having withstood more than most people ever could. If someone as \" backwards \" as Io can see it, surely someone else will too. She closes off her small speech with a joke, warning Uta if she ever talks so negatively about herself again, she'll be slapped so hard that it'll wipe her memories of the past entirely. It's a sentiment only for Uta, with Io even denying she'd ever do something of a similar sentimental nature for anyone else, even Sensei. Using this as a segue, Io returns to her previously mentioned arrangement idea , insisting it's the best option, especially since Sensei would be able to protect her with his height and stronger \"powers\". Uta remarks that the aforementioned powers just make her life more stressful . Io comments that Sensei might also be someone who can see the \"real\" Uta, as he seems to be just as broken up inside as she is. She points out more similarities between him and Uta, like how they both feel like they're undeserving of people's feelings, but still desperately need someone to cling on to. Uta's embarrassed to hear this, and even more so as Io continues to insist on the chemistry between them, even claiming that theirs is better than the one Io has with him and how she would understand if they decide to leave her behind, but Uta will never do that since she needs her. Io finishes by pointing out more similarities between Uta and Sensei and how this is purely hypothetical since Uta isn't interested. As Uta stares off to the side, Io suggests that if her feelings ever change, she shouldn’t let anything or anyone, including her, hold her back.",
