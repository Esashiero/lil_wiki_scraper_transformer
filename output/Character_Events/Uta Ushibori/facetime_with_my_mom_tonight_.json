She is still expecting a call from her brother. Sensei asks why her brother is in prison â€” Uta says that it's a long story, but says that he's an idiot and tried to kill someone. Apart from that, she says, her family is fairly normal. They talk for a while about Uta's flirting, about some of her classmates, about her parents, and about how she came to the city.",
