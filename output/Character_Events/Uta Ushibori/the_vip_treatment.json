She does say that he can hire her for his house, but Sensei says that he already has Ami . Uta wonders whether he's supposed to be visiting dorm rooms, but Sensei tells her that it's normal — for him, anyway. She introduces him to Leonard the rhinoceros beetle. They talk about how she and Ami are doing at the maid cafe.",
