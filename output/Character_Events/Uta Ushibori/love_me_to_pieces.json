Uta is training a new girl and wants to use them as test subjects, which Io expects to be awkward and uncomfortable. The new maid turns out to be Osako Osaka , the instructor at Ayane 's dojo â€” she is trying out her options since the fate of the dojo is still uncertain . The conversation is somewhat awkward, especially as various people get confused over which inappropriate relationships Sensei is or is not carrying on. Sensei and Osako agree not to tell anyone about having seen each other in the maid cafe.",
