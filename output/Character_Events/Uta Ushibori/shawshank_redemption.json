She asks his advice on approaching other girls in their dorm, and Sensei tells her that she'll probably be fine if she just acts like herself. She and Sensei venture out into the corridor to get some water, and since her idea of being herself includes not bothering with pants, she draws attention from Tsuneyo and Molly . Sensei considers it a win that Uta is talking to people.",
