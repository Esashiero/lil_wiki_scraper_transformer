        "synopsis": "Sensei takes a walk outside and complains about the snow until he runs into Yumi , wondering why she isn’t spitting on cars . She claims that she has better things to do, but when he asks her if she managed to find a job, she says that she hasn’t looked for one since their last conversation . She’s waiting for Chika because she wants her help with Chinami ’s present, but he thinks that she can look for a job since they’re meeting is still a few hours away. She accepts when he annoys her too much and he knows a place where she could find a job, but doesn’t tell her where he takes her. He arrives with her at the porn shop. Yumi is angry for being dragged into one and Makoto demands that both of them leave. Yumi didn’t recognize her without her glasses and, after she puts them on, thinks that this is a big joke on her expense. Maki comes in and wants to know what’s going on. Sensei tells her that he’s looking for a job for Yumi and wants her to apply here. Maki agrees to interview her while Makoto wants to talk to him. She fears that Yumi will blackmail her now that she knows where she works, but he recommends to hire her and keep it a secret that way. She wants to know why he brought her here to look for a job. He tells her that he thought it was funny, that Yumi needed something to cheer her up and that he hoped that Makoto wasn’t working so he could buy something, making her wonder why she likes him. Meanwhile, Maki interviews Yumi, tries to make the job of a porn sales woman more appealing and assures her that she would do her best to let her work here. Yumi is a little impressed but escapes as soon as Maki wants to know about her sexual experiences and talks about the content of some of their videos. Sensei tries to follow her but is unable to keep up with her.",
