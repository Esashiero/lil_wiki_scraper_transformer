Sensei isn't sure if that's a good idea, given that his tendency to have what Yumi called \"mind-comas\" around Yumi and in the old district, but he loses control over his words and legs, and is somehow at the bridge. He mentions to Yumi that he doesn't even remember how he got there, and she tells him that if he isn't lying about not being a junkie, he ought to go to hospital — his blackouts are getting out of hand, and she doesn't want it to happen in front of Chika or Chinami . Sensei finds himself in an abyss talking with someone who has a temporary appearance. He is offered the chance of going somewhere outside this half of town, but instead asks to go back to Yumi (who is also known by a different name). Yumi has pulled him out of the way and propped him against a railing on the bridge — he thanks her for that. Before she goes, Yumi tells him not to do anything which will hurt Chika.",
