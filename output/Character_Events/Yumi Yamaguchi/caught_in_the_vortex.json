Yumi says that she is surprised her mother even remembers her, given that she \"ran out\" on her a long time ago. Yumi says that her mother — \"Yakuza-wife\", biker gang member, and drug addict — has \"no way of escaping a place like this\", and that Yumi could end up the same. Yumi starts tearing up, and is initially angry that Sensei tries \"being nice\" to her instead of telling her to grow up and get over it, but she appreciates it when Sensei simply acts as though it didn't happen.",
