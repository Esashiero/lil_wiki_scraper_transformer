        "synopsis": "Sensei takes Yumi to Tojo Ramen so that she can ask for a job, and as they walk, Yumi talks about the district they're in. She says that living in a place like that gradually drains you of whatever hope and dreams you might have had, and that although she doesn't want to end up like the people she has seen, nothing can be guaranteed. As they approach the shop, they see the woman who talked to Sensei there before â€” she turns out to be Yumi's mother, and Yumi doesn't want to see her. While Sensei distracts Yumi's mother, Yumi talks to Tsuneyo , and makes some progress after falling back on Sensei's interview advice . When her mother enters the shop, however, Yumi immediately leaves. Before Sensei leaves to go after her, Yumi's mother introduces herself to Sensei as Yuki .",
