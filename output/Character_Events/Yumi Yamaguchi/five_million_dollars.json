She is surprised when Sensei says it's fine if she continues to skip classes, and talks a bit about what she does instead of attending school. Sensei asks what he can do to to establish better relations, but since the contents of his wallet fall somewhat short of the $5,000,000 she names as a price, she tells him to go away.",
