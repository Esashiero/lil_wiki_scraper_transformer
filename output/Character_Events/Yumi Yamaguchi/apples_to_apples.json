        "synopsis": "Sensei encounters Yumi while walking the streets of Kumon-mi, and decides it's time for them to head to the cafe for Yumi's first attempt at getting a job. Yumi, surprised, protests, pointing out how adults normally treat the job search process, but Sensei rebuts, telling her certain things don't matter at a young age, especially not for part-time jobs. After a brief back-and-forth over Yumi's need for money and Sensei's reflection on his own finances, the two head to the cafe, Yumi following as Sensei walks her there. Right before they enter, Yumi suddenly has second thoughts, but with some encouragement from Sensei, the two enter to begin Yumi's quest. Rin greets Sensei enthusiastically as he and Yumi enter, but tails off quickly when she notices Yumi, who greets her in her normal roundabout way. Rin asks Sensei why Yumi is with him, and upon his answer, he turns to calm Yumi down from his joke before she can tarnish her impression. Rin, surprised to learn Yumi wants to apply for a job, starts passive-aggressively questioning Sensei on his choice and Yumi of her interest, before resolving herself to follow through with the initial intent and going to the back to get Haruka . Once Rin leaves, Yumi seems to understand the gravity of the situation and dismisses Sensei after a quick bit of banter, and Sensei takes a seat at a table elsewhere in the cafe to observe while Yumi sits at one of the tables closest to the door.  Rin brings Haruka back out and directs her to Yumi's table, and Haruka sits down to begin the interview. She asks Yumi typical questions like her previous background, references, and experience in the field, she begins running Yumi through a workplace scenario. Yumi's response immediately guarantees that Sensei will have to find another place to help her apply to, and Haruka dismisses Yumi. Outside the cafe, Yumi, excited, asks to make sure she'll still be getting free lunch, and though Sensei already knows exactly what's going to happen from this point forward, he can't bring himself to bring down Yumi's mood, and Sensei leaves to go about his evening.",
