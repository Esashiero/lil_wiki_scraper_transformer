        "synopsis": "Sensei is wandering the streets of the city, wondering about what he's going to do today, only to hear Yumi cursing to herself nearby. He turns to her and tries to greet her, only to be venomously rebuffed and accused of stalking her.  Yumi, annoyed, sits against the phone booth they're standing next to, knocking over a coffee cup inside and making a mess, which Sensei tries to get her to clean up, to no avail. Sensei says it was a joke, and Yumi replies he needs to try a lot harder to get her anywhere close to laughing. She fires back with an attempt at a joke of her own, only for Sensei to predict the answer, shocking and disgusting her. When she asks why he'd say that, and what his reasoning is, he replies that it's because she's not wearing pants, but a skirt, which surprisingly makes her snort and briefly smile. Yumi quickly shuts Sensei down when he points this out, and makes numerous threats to cause him severe bodily harm if anyone ever finds out about her smile, and vehemently reaffirms her hatred for him. Yumi then turns off into the distance, talking about how she's walked down this path for so long it's better if she stays down it instead of trying to change anything. Sensei tries to compliment her, and she fails to give an immediate reply, instead blowing him off with more insults and walking down the street, while Sensei decides to go about his evening.",
