She makes multiple rude and disparaging comments regarding Sensei's presence and behavior, while also insulting some of the other classmates. Without much fanfare, Yumi angrily tells Sensei to leave before storming into her dorm room, shutting the door behind her. Sensei takes the encounter in stride and heads home to go to bed.",
