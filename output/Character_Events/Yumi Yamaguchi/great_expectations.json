He tells her that being less tense would help, and that if she's asked a question about where she sees herself in ten years, she she probably shouldn't mention jail. She says that, given her lack of suitable skills and attributes, people tend not to have any great expectations for her future . Sensei points out that Tsuneyo probably isn't the most conventional interviewer anyway, and that just praising noodles may be sufficient.",
