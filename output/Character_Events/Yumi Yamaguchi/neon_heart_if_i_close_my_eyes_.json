        "synopsis": "Sensei follows his gut feeling and finds a crying and frustrated Yumi punching a wall in an alleyway. Because she’s still afraid of him, she notices him right away and demands to know why he’s still spending time with Yuki even though she doesn’t want him to. He explains that he only helped her to hand out fliers for her work so she can get her new presents for Ayane’s pond . She isn’t interested in any presents from her unless it’s a way to give her her childhood back. Sensei asks her why she’s here in the first place and she admits that she was looking for a job since she can’t find one near the dorms. She complains about how she is crying so much since he’s involved in her life and wonders why no one leaves her alone. Sensei doesn’t answer her but wonders if he can’t leave her alone out of sexual desire, the desire to make amends or the desire to keep someone close who doesn’t fall for him and gives him a balanced life in the process. Yumi manages to calm down a little and complains about his perverted nature again. Sensei asks why she doesn’t transfer into another class if she doesn’t want to be in his. She explains that, since she’s a delinquent, she has nowhere left to go and that he should just ignore her, but he says that he can’t do that. She can’t understand why, considering everything she did and what happened between them, but Sensei points out that she’s usually angry when she speaks to him. She’s done being angry for the day and instead tempts him with her vulnerability, even closing her eyes to make it easier for him to take advantage of her. Sensei’s mind breaks again, but nothing happened when he comes back to his senses. Unwilling to do something to her and seeing no benefit in giving her another slap to the face, he just begs her to stop. Yumi is surprised, but when he asks her if she hoped that something would’ve happened, she gets angry, complains about him being too close and decides to go home. He offers to accompany her, but Yumi, feeling down and exhausted, says that she will be fine on her own. Sensei waits for her to leave and goes home.",
