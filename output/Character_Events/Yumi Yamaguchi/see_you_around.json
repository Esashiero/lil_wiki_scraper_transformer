        "synopsis": "An unknown narrator describes the current scene in class, explains that Sensei is currently somewhere else without doing anything of importance and starts a monologue about the nature of teenage girls. He wonders who our current protagonist is and lets the scene play out so we can find out. Rin asks her friends if short hair would suit her, because she likes the look of the short-haired girls in her manga and wants to be like them. Otoha likes her current look but thinks that she should do it if she really wants to. She then invites Futaba to accompany them to go shopping the day before Christmas, which she agrees to. Meanwhile, Yumi appears in class the same time Chika wants to look for Sensei. Chika wonders why she’s here, realizes what she intends to do and is proud of her for finally doing something nice. Yumi gets sick of her praise, begs her to stop and makes a snarky remark about how she shouldn’t fall for her instead of their teacher. While she has no intention to do that, she wouldn’t mind letting her join them and leaves before she can finish her reply. The narrator confirms that Yumi is the protagonist and that she plans to do something nice. He starts a monologue about how plans are just that, but before he can finish, Yumi makes her way to someone and the narrator is eager to see what’s going to happen. Yumi reaches Futaba’s desk and asks her if they can talk outside, but Nodoka intervenes. Yumi just wants to talk to Futaba, but Nodoka has no intention to let her since she thinks that she’ll only hurt her again. The conversation gets more and more heated while Rin and Otoha get more and more worried as time goes on. It escalates, but before Yumi can resort to violence, Tsuneyo holds her back while Rin tries to calm Nodoka down. Yumi gives up after a while and Tsuneyo lets her go since she doesn’t see her as a threat anymore. Nodoka recommends to let her be so she can feel miserable for once, but Futaba follows her. Futaba is able to catch up with her, but Yumi doesn’t want to talk with her anymore and makes it look like she just wanted to make fun of her again. Futaba knows that this isn’t the case, apologizes for what Nodoka did and intends to listen to her. Yumi tells her that she’s aware why her friends don’t want her near her, that she wants to better herself and apologizes for everything she did to her. Much to her surprise, Futaba forgives her for no particular reason and leaves. Sensei appears behind Yumi, lets her know that he heard her apology and that he’s proud of her.",
