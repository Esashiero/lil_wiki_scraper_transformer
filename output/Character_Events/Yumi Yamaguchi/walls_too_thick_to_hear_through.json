In the middle of her response, Sensei finds himself back in \" a moment of great importance \". Then he is back in Yumi's dorm room — she is shaking him and telling him to stop going into a \"mind-coma\" or whatever it is while he is around her, since it creeps her out and she hadn't finished yelling at him. She makes it clear that she doesn't want to see her mother, and Sensei leaves.",
