        "synopsis": "Feeling the way he usually does, Sensei decides to head to the Miyamura family's store, hoping that Maki is manning the store tonight as Makoto refuses to serve him. Upon arriving at the store, he finds Sara , Maki, and Haruka all gathered around the storefront. After failing to get them to help with his shopping, Sara says he's arrived right on time, as he can fill in for her. Haruka is sad to hear this, suggesting that Sara let Yuki or Sana man the bar, but she negates this by claiming she needs to be more responsible now that her business is doing well. With Sara gone, Sensei moves closer to the remaining two, asking for clarification about what he's being included in. Haruka explains that she bought three tickets to a resort for the weekend as a token of appreciation for Maki's friendship â€“ Maki instead quips that it's to help her get over her dead husband . Haruka insists this isn't the sole reason, telling Maki to explain the other thing troubling her lately. Maki reveals that she hasn't been \"feeling herself\" lately, causing Sensei to both realize the severity of the situation and question the friendship between the girls. Haruka further explains that she thought the idea up as a way to make up for how bad a friend she's been lately. From here, the event diverges depending on if Sensei pursued both Haruka and Maki:",
