He makes a funny comment, that Makoto played the very same game sequence when he and Maki first met. Few moments after, Makoto shows up and decides to ruin the fun, but the two seasoned adults poke her with witty remarks and cause her to get ashamed. After Makoto's depart, Sensei and Maki continue to discuss the various intricacies of porno games and share the enjoy of mutual understanding. Logically, it leads to both of them heading to the back door room, and their meeting had a rather fruitful outcome.",
