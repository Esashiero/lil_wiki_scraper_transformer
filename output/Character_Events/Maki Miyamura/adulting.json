        "synopsis": "Maki arrives at the cafe a short while after Sensei . She makes an awkward joke since it’s her way of dealing with pain, but Sensei doesn’t mind. She’s happy about that since he’s the first person who she can talk about it, which makes him wonder why she didn’t contact her friends. She tells him that she already informed Sara and that they agreed to meet up later, while she talked with Haruka this morning, because she got frustrated yesterday after receiving a message about her husband being alive. Maki wants to talk with him about his passing. He’s interested, but wasn’t sure if she would since it wouldn’t be good for her mental health, but she assures him that she’s fine now. Rin appears at their table and asks her if everything is fine with Makoto , because she heard about her being called to the front office and both her and Miku never returned to class afterwards. She tells her that she’s fine, that Makoto won’t be attending school for a while and that she will tell them what happened if she ever feels ready for it. Rin takes their order and leaves. Maki stares at her and Sensei lets her do it. He dreaded this meeting because he’s terrible in cheering people up and knows that he can’t sway Maki’s mood with some hollow phrases. Maki likes Rin but thinks she’s high maintenance. Sensei points out that Miku is as well, but she informs him that Miku is very easy to handle when her past isn’t involved, which is why she sees her as a second daughter. Sensei brings the mood down and Maki decides to get back on track since she can’t ignore it. She tells him that she got an automated call informing her about her husband, who died by asphyxiation \ntwo months ago. She takes it personally that his death was delivered this way, but she’s also worried about her daughter. Sensei tells her that, like Makoto, she lost someone important and suggests her to grieve. Maki explains that she needs to stay strong for Makoto’s sake and can grieve once everything has calmed down. Haruka enters the cafe, gets the order Rin prepared for them and delivers it to their table. Once she placed it on their table, she gives Maki her condolences, while Sensei contemplates about how giving condolences is hollow and meaningless when it comes from someone uninvolved. Maki wants to talk with her later, though, and gets back to Sensei to discuss Makoto’s school work during her absence. Sensei doesn’t think that she has to worry about that, not only because he doesn’t care, but, foremost, because they shouldn’t worry about that during their time of grieving. They decide to separate and Sensei watches her leave, hoping that she would break down once she’s outside, but, as expected, she doesn’t.",
