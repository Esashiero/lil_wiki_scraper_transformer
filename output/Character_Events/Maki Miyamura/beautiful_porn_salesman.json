They meet at the Koi Cafe, and Sensei is surprised at how direct she is (especially given that she is Makoto 's mother). Despite earlier saying that she would support Sensei on his date, Molly decides that Maki is a succubus from whom Sensei needs protecting. Maki plays along until Molly gets flustered and retreats. Sensei and Maki talk for a while, and Maki mentions that her marriage is an open relationship.",
