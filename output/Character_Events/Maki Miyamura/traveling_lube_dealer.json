Once Sensei arrives, he is surprised to find that Maki - under the pseudonym Felicity Fellatio - is already there and is soliciting Ami to purchase a special lotion that will keep her looking young and energetic. Ami notices Sensei has arrived home, and the three engage in lotion discussion. Sensei does not entertain Maki's act and reveals that Maki is not, in fact, a traveling lotion salesperson named Felicity Fellatio, but is Makoto's mother. Ami is upset that Maki lied to her, and attempts to kick her out of the house. However, Sensei instead grounds Ami and sends her to her room until Maki leaves. Maki reveals that she is pleased that Ami is upset with her because of her grievances with Makoto, but that ultimately this pleasure comes more from a desire to ease pressure off of Makoto. Maki wishes that Makoto was more family-oriented like Ami, and Sensei offers to hear out her problems in the future. The two end up going out for dinner, leaving Ami in her room.",

This contradicts an earlier attempt to do in the event Declaration of War . It's possible Sensei doesn't count this previous attempt, as it was delivered half-heartedly.",
