        "synopsis": "Sensei decides to call Maki to check on her after their situation calmed down a little. She still feels miserable, so Sensei invites her over so he can help reduce her misery on the outside. She doesn’t mind since she needs to bring Makoto to her therapy session in his area. Once she arrives, Maki feels glad to be invited again, because she thought that her kidnapping him would’ve prevented him from inviting her ever again, but he doesn’t hold it against her, especially since she wasn’t invited that day. He wonders how long she can stay until she needs to pick up Makoto, but he hears Makoto’s voice and sees her appearing behind her mother. He fears that he’s the therapist, but Maki assures him that she’s meeting someone else. At that moment, Ami appears and invites Makoto into her room to talk with her. Before they leave, Maki and Sensei make them feel uncomfortable with some lewd jokes. Maki can’t believe that Ami turned out to be the one saving her . Sensei isn’t surprised, since they have something painful in common now, but is surprised that Miku couldn’t save her. Maki reminds him that she hasn’t processed her pain either while Ami processed it enough to not hide it behind walls. Maki makes her jealousy of Ami known before both decide to let them do their therapy session in peace. Maki and Sensei take a seat at Sensei’s dinner table. She’s glad that Makoto and her are getting closer now, even if their progress is slow, and how she understands why Makoto acted like she did when she felt miserable. With her husband gone and her daughter being the only thing she has left, she also has nothing else to dread anymore and wants to know if Sensei has someone he dreads loosing. He admits that there is someone, but can’t put his relationship with that person into words. He admits that he would be better off not worrying about that load on his back, he’s still fine with carrying it. Maki goes into a monologue about how worries are replaced by more worries once they’re gone and how their worries are caused by people close to them, giving them a reason to live on and making them more wary of things we saw as safe before, which he notices when Maki points out that she looks both ways before crossing a one-way street she crossed for years now. The therapy session ends with some happiness and a lot of crying. Maki is happy with her daughter’s progress while Sensei is glad of his niece and, once he gets back to his room, feels satisfied in being able to go to sleep without having to overthink something.",
