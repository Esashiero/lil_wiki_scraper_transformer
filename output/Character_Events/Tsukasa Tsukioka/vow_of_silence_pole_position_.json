        "synopsis": "Sensei gives Tsukasa a call, who wants to know how he got her number since not even Touka has it, and he explains that Tsubasa added it to his contacts so he can call her in regards to their tutoring sessions. Despite the poor result of their first session , Sensei's own incredulousness at even having made the phone call, and his wish for Tsukasa to hang up for her own sake, they end up scheduling another session at the estate , with Tsukasa comparing this to a job interview. She demands he arrives in the next ten minutes, but when Sensei reminds her that he lives too far away and can't teleport himself to her, she decide to give him some help and asks him to close his eyes. When Sensei is asked to open them again, he finds himself in the gardens of the estate and in front of Tsukasa, who's accompanied by her personal servants and ready to start the interview. While she finds his behavior questionable and is also dissatisfied with him refusing to fight her henchmen to prove his fighting prowess, Tsukasa still hands him the job due to her general interest in him and some personal reasons, also expecting to learn things that others have not taught her, as well as entertainment. She then proposes they move to her nearest bedroom for the tutoring session, the privacy of which has Sensei feeling uneasy. Regardless, his concerns are ignored by the girl and he is ushered in by her servants. Upon arriving at her two-story bedroom, Tsukasa gives Sensei a guided tour of the space. The latter is thankful that her servants are present, lest he lose control of himself while near her. She then asks him if he wants to see a cool trick she learned from her mother. She raises her hand, and all of the servants leave the room, revealing that they only understand hand gestures due to their vow of silence. He's impressed but asks her to do the gesture that summons them back, as he would be more comfortable with them in the room, but she mentions she gets nervous and uncomfortable when she has to do things in front of other people and thus prefers to be alone. Sensei presses on with his request, prompting Tsukasa to ask him if he doesn't want to be alone with her, because she annoyed him when they were alone in his office . She promises to be good and tells him that if she ever annoys him, all he has to do is raise his hand and she will be silent until he permits her to speak. She then excitedly runs upstairs, towards her bed, and Sensei finds himself giving into her request to follow. Despite being aware of the faults in his actions, Sensei sits besides Tsukasa on her bed and listens to her as she happily lists off the names of her plushies. The conversation then shifts to what subjects he would be most suited to tutor her on. They quickly land on literature as the most adequate field, and Tsukasa reveals that she read The Catcher in the Rye since it peaked her interest when he mentioned it during their first session and had nothing else to do after he left her and Chinami . She then explains her interpretation of the book and how she relates to its message, though as she speaks, she reminds Sensei of Noriko , which causes him to have a flashback to a discussion he had with her about the book. Sensei snaps back to reality after Tsukasa asks him if his brain is exploding again. He confesses how she reminded him of someone he knows and that he didn't expect her to read the book. The girl tells him she only did so because she was bored, but is ultimately happy that they have found something they both enjoy, and how both of them can have fun with it while he teaches her all sorts of things. Since she still calls him Jeeves, he corrects her, stating that she must call him \"Sensei\" while they are there.",
