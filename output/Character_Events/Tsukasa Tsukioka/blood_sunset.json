        "synopsis": "After their tutoring session , Sensei and Tsukasa take a walk through the estate's sakura garden. He's lost in thoughts until Tsukasa calls out to him, asking if he already saw it with her mother , which he confirms . She wonders if he likes this garden if he decided to return to it, but when he doesn't respond, wonders how her mother keeps the tree in bloom over the entire year, with Sensei assuming she somehow controls the weather. After he gets lost in thoughts again, Tsukasa asks if he intends to continue tutoring her, not because she likes his tutoring but his company, yet requests he changes his clothes to something more suitable so he doesn't end up confusing their servants. He makes a sarcastic comment on their treatment of the staff, and when she fails to notice it, decides to teach her sarcasm during their next session. During this, she assumes that he intends to assassinate her due to a comment about him keeping a list of her interests, with her being under the superstition that lists will end in assassination attempts, but when he confirms that being around him might be dangerous, she doesn't mind it, as being around a dangerous individual is better than being alone and bored. When Sensei tries to set boundaries between them by clarifying that he's nothing more than her tutor, Tsukasa wonders why he's behaving so strangely. He explains that she's revealing one of her weaknesses to him by admitting she's lonely, but Tsukasa points out that he's doing the same â€“ He's only with her because he can't see Touka right now and has no other option, so he chose to spend time with her, a failsafe. She's fine with it, because being a failsafe is her existence in a nutshell, but when Sensei tries to argue against it, she reveals that every staff member says that about her, having heard them say so when she spied on them. He feels sorry for her being treated like this, but she assures him she's fine, especially since she can fire them whenever she wants. She also tells him that she hears more interesting stories while spying on her servants, one of which regards a rumor of the sakura garden. According to the rumor, there's a ghost haunting it, similar to the one haunting Sensei, with the ghost of the manor being apparently a former gardener who died under the tree or the former owner of the tree who was buried under it and won't rest until she can find her missing child. Sensei begins to \"black out\" again, and an entity, most likely Sekai , advises him to bury his impurities below the eiderdown, and another entity, named Onund, asks him to reach out to and take them. As he does it, he comes back to reality, where his hand rests on Tsukasa's head, who's confused on why he's touching her. The next moment, he finds himself back home, terrified by the mistake he almost committed.",
