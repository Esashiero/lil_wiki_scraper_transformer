        "synopsis": "Sensei decides to call Tsukasa again, blaming that decision on the forces that made him do it and trying to convince himself that it's fine since it's what everyone wants him to do, only to crumble once she picks up. He asks her if she's fine having another tutoring session, and she agrees, but notes that she isn't at the manor but in her apartment in Touka 's apartment complex . He asks her to teleport him to her again, but she tells him that even someone as affluent as her hasn't the means to teleport anyone and asks him to get there by himself before hanging up on him. As he enters her apartment, Sensei wonders how him being here would look to the other girls and desperately wishes that one of them would be here to guide him on the right path, as he's currently lost. He notices how her room contains expensive furniture, and she explains she hired designers to make her room look like a room of an \"average commoner girl\". After some sarcastic statements she once again fails to pick up and having to talk his way out of a situation he created after making a careless remark, he wonders why he even bothered coming here, which she finds weird as well due to how their last two meeting ended, noting how the last time someone touched her head didn't end well for that person. He wants to change the subject, and she invites him on her bed to discuss their next move. After reluctantly joining her, Tsukasa tells him that she has to fire him as her tutor and wants to hire him as her entertainment manager, a position he immediately rejects. She's shocked to hear him refuse her offer, which she created for his sake, explaining that she still wants to spend time with him but in a way more suitable to his interests. She wants to be seen as an outstanding individual, but the only time he saw her as one was when she gave him her thoughts about literature. He tells her that this is just what he's good at, having specialized in it because being able to understand people and their worldviews is more impressive, beneficial and challenging than solving complex physical formulas or being knowledgeable about astronomy. When Tsukasa feels like analyzing literature isn't any different to other dissection processes, he tries to proof his point by asking her about her favorite book, noting how her choice of The Secret Garden and how she feels free when reading it sad, and explains how her feelings about the story and her opinions on the underlying themes show an understanding of humanity that other fields lack. Tsukasa interprets his explanation as his desire to understand people better, which he never thought about, and wants to follow his advice in the future, but he's still surprised by the fact that anyone actually does. Tsukasa sees his point, though, as she has a hard time understanding his recent actions. While her mother asked him to tutor her, he's still approaching her on his own volition, giving her more attention than anyone else in her life, and while she hopes that he does it because he wants to, she's too used being around people who expect something in return for their company. She reaffirms her status as a failsafe, adding that she's so disposable no one would care if anything happened to her, and if he wants something from her, she would gladly give it to him as a reward for his kindness, as long as it's something she can provide him. One thing she wants to know, though, is if he spends time with her because he likes her, with Sensei either confirming this or ending their session.",
