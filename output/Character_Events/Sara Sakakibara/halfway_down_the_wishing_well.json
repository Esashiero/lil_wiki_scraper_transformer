        "synopsis": "Walking upstairs, Yuki finds Sensei in the middle of a “blackout”, with Sara unconscious. After telling him to stop acting so weird, and him continuing to do so, she locks him into a chokehold, forcing him to unconsciousness while Sara slowly wakes up. Coming to, Sensei finds himself sitting on Sara's couch, with no idea what happened. Sara explains that he interrupted a serious conversation by suddenly choking her out, rendering her unconscious, on top of doing various other things to her. Shocked, Sensei tries to apologize, but Sara refuses to accept it, saying she understands. Sensei tells her she can't possibly understand, trying to explain how his “blackouts” work and what they do to him, but Sara tells him there's no need - She understands because she used to experience the same thing. Left speechless, Sara continues. In the past, she used to experience strange or unexplainable things, such as shadows following her, figures speaking to her in indecipherable language, or entire chunks of the day disappearing without her noticing. She mentions always feeling attracted to Sensei, and while she initially wrote it off as nothing but her personal preferences, she's begun to feel like there's much more to it than that. She asks Sensei if he thinks she's crazy. He says she's not, but that what they experience can't ever be explained. Sara says she doesn't need an explanation, nor was she even expecting to find someone to relate to, but got lucky this time – Lucky that the person she took an interest in was someone who was similarly “broken” like she is. She tells Sensei once again that they need to look after Sana, as she's already begun to experience these things . Sensei wonders how they can do that when they don't even understand the circumstances themselves, much less have a solid plan on how to keep Sana safe. Sara asks for a suggestion from him, but Sensei is similarly at a loss, only saying that he'll support the two of them no matter what choice is made. Sensei spends the night at Sara's house.",
