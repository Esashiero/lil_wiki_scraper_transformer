She appreciates his flirting, strange as it is, saying that it makes her feel young again. After walking around the city for a while, Sensei and Sara talk about Sensei's choice about what sort of relationship he wanted with her. Sara then asks for ideas to improve business at her bar, but Sensei doesn't have anything to offer beyond his own continued patronage. Sara tells Sensei that she enjoys spending time with him, and asks if they can meet like this again.",
