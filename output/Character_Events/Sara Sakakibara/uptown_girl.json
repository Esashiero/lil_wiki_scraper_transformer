They talk about the differences and similarities between Sara and Sana , and about how Sara was when she was that age. Among other things, Sara says that she once wanted to be famous and adored â€” she points to a billboard of Niki Nakayama to illustrate her point. She doesn't believe Sensei when he tells her that Niki is his ex-girlfriend, so he calls Niki (much to Niki's annoyance) to prove it.",
