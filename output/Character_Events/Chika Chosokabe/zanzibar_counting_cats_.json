When she eventually wakes up, they talk about whether or not to tell anyone about the progress of their relationship — Chika wants to at least tell Yumi , but Sensei thinks that it would cause problems. They compromise — Chika won't actively tell Yumi, but won't lie about it either, and will make sure Yumi doesn't tell anyone else. Chika is a bit sad about having to leave the onsen after having so much fun. Before they go, they meet Tsubasa and Tsukasa , who heard them playing \"games\" overnight. Chika and Tsubasa exchange contact information.",
