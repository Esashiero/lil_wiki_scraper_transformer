        "synopsis": "Sensei enters the dorm hallway to find Chika standing outside her dorm room, looking at a video on her phone. He approaches and greets her, asking what she was watching, and she tells him that one of her coworkers from the shopping mall uploaded a video where she had taught her dog how to do math. Chika gives Sensei her phone so he can watch, and he finds this to be true, to his brief bafflement. The two debate the dog's future climb through society, and Sensei makes a disguised reference to his own situation in the world, which Chika unintentionally affirms by referencing the insane amount of Grammy awards Kanye West has won. Afterward, Chika realizes that Sensei is in the dorms to begin with, and asks whether that's against the rules, to which Sensei replies with his tailor-made dismissive response. Chika says she doesn't mind hanging out with Sensei, but that they can't go into her room yet because she is almost certain Yumi would kill her if she found out. Chika asks Sensei to tell her more about himself as a support for the informal teaching method, and Sensei, having not expected the question, immediately draws blanks and goes into his own head to formulate a response. He tries to tell Chika how he was once a good writer, only for the world to 'glitch' and stop him from elaborating why he doesn't write now. Chika tries to talk to Sensei about some other things, only for Yumi to bang on the door behind Chika, complaining that she's being too loud and interrupting her sleep. Chika and Sensei bid each other a quick farewell, and Chika heads back inside her room, while Sensei heads back home to go to bed.",
