Once they arrive, they meet Tsukasa Tsukioka and her mother Tsubasa — Sensei recognises them as the richest family in town , although Touka isn't with them today. Tsubasa deduces that Sensei and Chika are \"together\", but doesn't seem bothered by it. Sensei and Chika go their room. Chika asks how Sensei feels about being her \"first\" tonight — but not quite yet, because she wants to go relax in the hot spring to mentally prepare herself.",
