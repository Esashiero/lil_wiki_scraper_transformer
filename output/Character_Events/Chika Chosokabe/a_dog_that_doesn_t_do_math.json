To protect her fragile health, she is wearing a helmet/mask that covers her whole head, and which looks like a dog's head. Chika strikes on the idea of using Sensei as a babysitter for Chinami. They run into Ami and Maya , who think that walking around the mall holding hands with a barking young girl in a dog mask is weird behavior even by Sensei's standards.",
