They talk about Chika's relationship with Sensei, and how it differs from Tsubasa's relationship with her husband â€” Tsubasa says that her husband is a good man, but she never had the kind of love that Chika does. Tsubasa would like to know how Chika's first time goes. Tsukasa joins them until her mother gets annoyed at her. Chika appreciates her conversation with Tsubasa, and accepts Tsubasa's advice to directly spell out her feelings for Sensei.",
