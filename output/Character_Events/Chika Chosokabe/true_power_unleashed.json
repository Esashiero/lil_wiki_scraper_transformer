Chika doesn't have much money available, and Sensei offers to pay her phone bills (which turn out to include not just her phone and Chinami's, but also Yumi 's as well). Chika argues for a while, but reluctantly accepts. She asks if it's okay to kiss him, but Sensei thinks that it isn't the right place for that. After they buy a phone for Chinami, the three exchange phone numbers.",
