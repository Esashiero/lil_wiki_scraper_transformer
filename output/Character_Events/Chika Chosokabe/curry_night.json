        "synopsis": "Wanting to follow up with Chika about her search for a new job , Sensei calls her to see if she's free. Chika quickly informs her that she's off work, but is spending the day with Tsubasa , who's brought over Tsukasa to play with Chinami . She invites him over and he begins to make his way to the Chosokabe Flat. Upon arriving, Sensei finds Chinami and Tsukasa to be deep into their usual games , with Chika and Tsubasa standing in the kitchen. Chika welcomes him, explaining she was just in the middle of telling Tsubasa a story about her mother. Sensei's a bit surprised, as he's never heard any stories about her before with Chika explaining that, since he never talks about his, she assumed it'd be an awkward subject for him. Sensei denies there being any animosity between him and his parents, and Chika continues her story. Chika recounts a story from a couple of years after Chinami was born: Having lost a bracelet she recently acquired, Chika was spending her time looking around their apartment for it – Meanwhile, her mother was sitting in the kitchen, making curry for dinner. Upon finding her bracelet in Chinami's playpen, she joins her mother, asking when it is that Chinami will return from her routine blood work. Her mother, Chiaki, teases her for being too embarrassed to admit she cares about Chinami but confirms that she'll be returning home in another three hours. Chika responds with annoyance, confused why it'll take so long and why they even need to take so much blood from Chinami at all. Her mother reminds her that Chinami is special and needs to have these tests so they can figure out what's wrong with her in the first place. A sudden coughing fit breaks up the conversation, and Chika panics as she rushes to grab her mother's inhaler. Back in the present, Tsubasa, tearing up from the emotional story, drags Chika into a tight hug, declaring she's free to live with the Tsukiokas if she wishes. Chika's taken aback by this offer and refuses, saying it's far too much to do so casually. She appreciates the offer, but her current home allows her to more easily control Chinami's health – Plus, she has a deep sentimental attachment to the place. Tsubasa understands, telling Chika her offer will remain open indefinitely. While Sensei was glad to get a glimpse at Chika’s past, he acknowledges that he shouldn’t have come today as he’s unable to relate to or empathize with anything she told him in meaningful ways.",
