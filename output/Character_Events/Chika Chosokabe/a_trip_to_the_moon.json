Ami isn't pleased, but softens as Chika makes a point of including her and dismissing the idea of wanting to be alone with Sensei. They sit down to watch TV. Chika talks about her family, but when Sensei mentions his past visit to Chika's house, Ami is irate. Chika and Sensei make up some stories to explain everything away, and although some of them are a little implausible, Ami calms down a little. Nevertheless, Sensei and Chika decide that it would be best for Chika to head home.",
