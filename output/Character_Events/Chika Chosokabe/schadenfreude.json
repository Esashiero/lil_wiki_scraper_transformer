Sensei says that this isn't very sweet and innocent of her, and they talk about whether she might secretly be perverted. They go over to Chika's bed, where she tells Sensei to kiss her. She says that she isn't ready for sex yet, so he does something else for her instead. Chika is loud enough that Makoto comes to investigate, forcing Sensei to hide under the bed.",
