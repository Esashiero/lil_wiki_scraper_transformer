        "synopsis": "Sensei aimlessly walks around the shopping mall until eventually encountering Chika , who is currently on a work break. She makes a bit of awkward banter, having not expected Sensei to sit with her, but Sensei quickly shifts the topic to something less awkward by asking where she works in the mall, and she says she works at a popular fashion boutique. Sensei turns the conversation to try and figure out what exactly Chika spends the money she gets on, but she quickly dismisses it with a non-answer. Sensei compliments her offhandedly, and Chika asks for confirmation, having not believed Sensei just gave her a compliment. After a brief exchange where Sensei beats around the bush, he repeats the compliment, which Chika quickly returns with one of her own. After some more banter where Chika asks Sensei about his love life, and the two returning one another's compliments a second time, Sensei begrudgingly excuses himself from the mall as Chika heads back to work.",
