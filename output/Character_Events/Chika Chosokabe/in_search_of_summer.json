        "synopsis": "Sensei , getting sick of winter, waits for Maya to appear in front of him, but Chika appears instead. During their conversation, Sensei realizes that, since she sees herself as his girlfriend, she lives in a dream world which is both a blessing, as she is easily swayed, and a curse, as she is blind to reality and will get hurt when she has to face it. Chika wants to have lunch with him in the cafeteria, thinking that them spending time together wouldn’t be weird during school hours, but Sensei points out that rumors about him exist due to his intimacy with his class. She explains that rumors will always exist and don’t mean anything, like the one about Niki being his ex. Sensei explains that this is the case, but she rationalizes it with them dating before Niki became an idol and, as a result, he never dated the idol version of her. She forces him to accompany her and Sensei sees it as an opportunity to remind her of the importance of keeping her feelings in check in public. The cafeteria is basically empty, except for Yasu , Touka , Io and Imani , which worries him a little. Instead of eating, Chika talks about Ami ’s dedication to him and the possibility of her and Chinami moving in once she’s out of high school. When Sensei explains that making plans this far into the future is pointless, she mockingly asks if he would run away with his ex, clarifying that with Niki being 22, according to public information, they could’ve never dated while she was in high school. She further explains that, if this were true, she would accidentally bite his penis off, scaring him for a moment. On that note, though, he tries to make her realizes that her being too open with her feelings puts both of them at risk and implores her to be more cautious. Chika, thinking that he is breaking up with her, panics and assures him that she didn’t intend to move too fast. Sensei calms her down, decides to get back to that later and recommends her to eat something, but she lost her appetite. As lunch comes to an end, he realizes how much this was his fault, as he enabled her fantasies, allowed them to flourish and was foolish enough to think that he could bring this up so casually.",
