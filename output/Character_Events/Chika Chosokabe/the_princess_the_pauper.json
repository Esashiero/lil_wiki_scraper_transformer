        "synopsis": "Sensei lies on his hotel bed and is lost in thought. He notices Io ’s scent and wonders if she will visit him again tonight. As the scenario plays out in his head, someone knocks at his door, and Chika and Touka enter his hotel room. Both are still completely drunk, especially Touka who’s mostly unaware of what’s going on around her, and Chika reveals that both want to talk to him about their date challenge and how Chika wants to gloat about her victory , whereas Touka is upset that she lost . Sensei asks them why they came to him and Chika indirectly suggests that Touka and she will compete in a bonus round in which both will act as models, both to fulfill her promise and to give Touka a fair chance. After both girls manage to get ready, Sensei just lets the modeling contest happen and tries his best to judge both contestants. The contest goes on with the girls doing their best, but both end up passing out at some point. Sensei, knowing that he has to deal with the aftermath, contacts the one person he can rely on in this situation. Nodoka , after Sensei promises that he had nothing to do with how this scene came to be, agrees to take care of the girls and to tell them who won their contest.",
