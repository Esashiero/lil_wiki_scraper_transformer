Arriving one hour too late, she finally enters and locks the door behind her, revealing that she only requested his service to spend more time with him and wonders if he has a TV or anything to entertain themselves in his office, but he informs her that this isn’t the case since his office also serves as a detention room. Chika remembers that Yumi mentioned something like this before and asks him if he can give her detention for ‘being a bad girl’. Sensei fulfills her request and quickly treats her like she actually has it. Two minutes later, Chika complains that he actually gave her detention instead of it being some kind of code he gave her in the dressing room . After flirting for a while, Sensei admits that he never intended to give her detention and only wanted to tease her before doing something fun with her.",
