She confesses her feelings for Sensei even though he already knows â€” she wants to say it out loud for once. She has trouble believing that Sensei might honestly like her back, but would like to keep what they have anyway. Sensei tells her that he can't reciprocate her love yet, because she currently lacks the confidence for a deeper relationship to work, but says that he'll be there for her as she tries to become happier with who she is.",
