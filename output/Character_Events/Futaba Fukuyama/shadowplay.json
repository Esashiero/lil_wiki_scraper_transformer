They have different opinions about whether it is worth taking a harder path for the sake of improving yourself. She finally tells him about her eating disorder. He thanks her for confiding in him, although declines her offer to share any of his own insecurities. The conversation turns back to the gym, and Sensei mentions that the \" scary blonde woman \" there was Yumi 's mother.",
