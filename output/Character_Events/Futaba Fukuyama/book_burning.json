        "synopsis": "Sensei knocks on Futaba 's dorm door. Unfortunately, even after waiting, she never answers and he returns home unsatisfied. A few hours later, Futaba, along with Yasu and Molly are riding the train, having just wrapped up some shopping for this year's Halloween costumes. While Molly's struggling to fully commit to her idea for Tsuneyo , Futaba's still yet to come up with any ideas, instead having spent their shopping trip purchasing a book. While Yasu pouts, claiming Futaba's reading habits to be indecent, Molly's more surprised with her recent bout of bibliomania. Futaba retorts that her reading volume is normal, especially if you account for how much time people would spend on other habits. She does admit, though, that her book choice this time is exceedingly abnormal, revealing to the two that she bought Nodoka 's newest release . Molly and Futaba continue to discuss at length the contents of Nodoka's latest book, further upsetting Yasu as its problematic contents become more and more clear. She insists the book be burned immediately, much to the confusion of Molly and Futaba. The situation is further exacerbated when Yasu begins to shout, claiming her God's voice is trying to warn her of the terrible fate that will befall her if she reads this book. The two girls become embarrassed as the subway's passengers begin to look in their direction, and they hurry to quiet Yasu down before they're kicked off. Later, after both Molly and Yasu have returned to their dorms, Futaba settles into hers. She lets out a sigh, exhausted from the ruckus Yasu caused but happy to finally have some alone time so she can read. This relief is lost when Rika walks into the room, exhausted from her work day and begging Futaba for a shoulder massage. As Futaba tries to subtly push her to leave, Rika steps closer, taking a glance at the book and instantly recognizing it from the book signing. Futaba's shocked to hear this, both because she hadn't been told there was a signing and because Rika's never expressed an interest in reading. Rika confirms she isn't into the book and just got wrapped up in the signing by accident, quipping that being around so many single women just made her feel worse. Futaba assures Rika that she'll find someone else, and hopefully somewhere else to live. Catching the hint, Rika decides to leave her alone for the night, deciding to check if Wakana and Imani want to meet up tonight. She also wonders if Sensei will be with them, but feels a bit awkward about the prospect of seeing him again. Futaba asks if something happened between them, but Rika claims she just gave him the wrong impression during their last conversation , which is something she has to fix on her own. Rika leaves shortly after, and Futaba, happy that she's alone, begins reading.",
