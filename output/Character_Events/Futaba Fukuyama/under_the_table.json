He confronts the librarian thief and finds out that she is Nodoka Nagasawa , a friend of Futaba's from another school. Nodoka is a writer, and Futaba says that she dives into \"unsightly topics\" a lot â€” something which Nodoka does not hesitate to confirm. After Nodoka has gone, Futaba offers to send Sensei some links to Nodoka's work, which leads to them exchanging phone numbers. When Sensei asks why Futaba went home from the beach early, she doesn't want to talk about it, although she does say that it isn't Yumi this time. She asks Sensei not to worry about it.",
