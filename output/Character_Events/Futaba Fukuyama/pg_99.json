        "synopsis": "Futaba bursts into Nodoka 's room, furiously asking Nodoka about the contents of the book . Nodoka responds flippantly to each of the subsequent questions thrown at her, prompting Futaba to send Otoha out into the hallway and to accuse Nodoka of stealing instead of using her artistic talents. Nodoka asserts the opposite is true, as she takes plenty of creative liberties for the parts she isn't present for. She continues, asking Futaba what the problem is with drawing inspiration from her life, even if it's so flagrant. Futaba argues it's the invasiveness that's the issue, especially when it can be felt so potently so early on in the story. Hearing this, Nodoka insists she continues reading, especially when Futaba threatens to stop speaking with her due to her supposedly callous view of her. Futaba agrees, being guided to her character's introduction. The contents of her character's introduction are revealed to be very beautiful, but while Futaba's touched Nodoka has so many nice things to say about her, she's still against the book entirely. Nodoka continues to not understand any of Futaba's complaints, particularly one about keeping the secrets of their class as her own â€“ For Nodoka, these secrets are her only real-world experiences, including the things that Futaba's struggled with, so it's obvious they would inspire her when writing characters with similar lives and insecurities. Continuing, she claims that if Futaba didn't want other people to know such private things about her, she should've kept a better lid on them. Nodoka explains how stories only have meaning when someone gives them one and vents her frustration about people not understanding her, until Futaba, thoroughly frustrated and now hurt, leaves with tears in her eyes, slamming the door behind her.",
