As she nervously starts to ask another question, Sensei guesses that she's going to confess her feelings to him, telling her that it's fairly obvious where their relationship is going. However, Futaba says that a confession \"comes later\", and what she's actually doing is inviting him to visit a new bookstore with her.",
