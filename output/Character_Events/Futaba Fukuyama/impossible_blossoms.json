After a quick bit of banter, Futaba goes to get her notebook, asking Sensei to review an assignment from the week before. Upon reading and examining the poem in question, Sensei gives his interpretation of the writer's thoughts and intentions. Afterward, Futaba asks him more about his new teaching method, and when Sensei elaborates on his situation a bit, he reminds Futaba to not just see herself as a student in his class anymore. She is worried about his reputation being damaged, and he points out there's no need to worry, as he doesn't have one due to the girls being the only people he actively associates with. Afterward, Sensei excuses himself, and after a couple rebuffed apologies from Futaba, he leaves to go about his day.",
