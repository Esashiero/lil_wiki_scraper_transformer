        "synopsis": "Sensei arrives in the first floor dorms and knocks on Futaba 's door, expecting her to answer due to the time they've spent together lately. Upon realizing Sensei is on the other side of the door, Futaba comes out almost immediately, slightly flushed. Sensei quickly asks to be let into Futaba's room, which she allows after a brief verbal debate over the suddenness of the whole affair. Futaba is very nervous, having never had a guy in her dorm room before, and starts ranting a bit and revealing embarrassing things about herself, before she manages to stop herself with Sensei's help. Sensei asks how the progress of his assignment for Futaba is shaping up, which she says hasn't gone very far - though Sensei is surprised by just how little she's managed to get done thus far. Sensei asks if there's anything he can do to help, reminding Futaba that she's supposed to see him more as a friend now than a teacher, and she stumbles over her words, but eventually gets out - with Sensei's help - that she wants a hug, which he quickly gives her, much to her surprise. Futaba gradually becomes more comfortable with the hug, and almost admits her feelings to Sensei, before the moment is destroyed by Ami calling Sensei out of the blue, much to both of their chagrin. Hearing the reason for Ami's call, Sensei promptly hangs up on her, slightly exasperated at Ami's overbearing nature. Futaba tries to console him, also noting Ami's unique disposition toward him. Afterward, Sensei tries to reignite the moment, only for Futaba to ask him to leave for the time being, as she is about to start more work on the assignment. Resigned, he parts ways with Futaba and heads home for the night.",
