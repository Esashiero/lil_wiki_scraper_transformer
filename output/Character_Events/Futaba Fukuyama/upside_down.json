        "synopsis": "Sensei arrives in the library to find Futaba waiting for him at the librarian's desk, a new notebook in hand as she doesn't want Sensei to read the first one . Futaba passes him the new notebook, and he comments on the avant-garde approach of writing the story in the middle of the book instead of the front, something which immediately catches Futaba's attention. The two begin reading, Futaba easily noting that whoever wrote this story, it wasn't her due to the handwriting, and the two have a quick chat about who the notebook could possibly belong to and where it came from, before continuing. However, the next few lines of the notebook force Sensei, perturbed, to slam the book shut and toss it on the table, not interested in reading any more due to the sudden and dramatic dark turn within. The two make idle conversation on several other topics for a while longer, but neither return their attention to the mysterious notebook, disturbed by the details within and the prospect of further darkness. Both Sensei and Futaba lament the fact that Futaba couldn't show Sensei her actual work, and she resolves to find it as soon as she gets back to the dorms. Eventually, Sensei bids Futaba farewell and leaves the library to go about his day.",
