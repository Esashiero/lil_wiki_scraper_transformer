        "synopsis": "Rin tells Sensei that Futaba is at the gym, and they both go to meet her there (with Sensei having some thoughts about mirrors and truth along the way). As they arrives, Yuki 's presence seems to be reminding Futaba unpleasantly of her encounter with Yumi . Futaba doesn't want Sensei to be there and tells him to leave, but Sensei stays and keeps talking. When Sensei eventually concludes that everything is \"back to normal\", Futaba angrily tells him that he should have respected her wishes, and to stop getting involved in every single aspect of her life. She tells him again to leave, and he goes home. Later, Futaba comes to his house and apologizes, saying that he was just trying to help and that she didn't entirely mean what she said. Sensei expresses surprise that he isn't the one having to apologize.",
