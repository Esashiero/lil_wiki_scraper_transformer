        "synopsis": "Sensei arrives in the first floor dorms, and pays another visit to Futaba , hoping for a better visit than the last time. Just to make sure he isn't interrupted , he turns off his phone before Futaba answers the door. She tells him to wait, as she doesn't 'look normal' at the moment, but after another few minutes of Sensei waiting and another attempt, Futaba caves and lets him in. Futaba stares at Sensei, somewhat flustered, and apologizes for not being in normal attire due to her clothes being in the wash. She is a bit concerned with her appearance, but Sensei casually brushes it off, saying it's not nearly as bad as his evening attire, the state of which causes Futaba to freeze up in shock. Sensei is forced to poke her on the cheek to snap her back to reality. Futaba apologizes for her sudden strange behavior, but Sensei's blunt explanation for why she's acting that way almost makes her freeze again. Her thoughts are derailed entirely when he admits the same explanation applies to him. Eventually, Futaba is able to take back control of her own mental state, and she asks Sensei why he feels the need to spend so much time around her as opposed to the other girls, and he honestly answers that it's just something he wants to do. Futaba reluctantly accepts this answer, and admits to Sensei that she's also been thinking about him a lot as well. Futaba suggests the two part ways before things get weird, though, and Sensei agrees, eager for the next time where they just might. He promptly leaves to go home and get to bed.",
