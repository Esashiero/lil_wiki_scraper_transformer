Still feeling like keeping some distance between her , he contemplates not entering, but eventually bites the bullet. He steps in to find Nodoka in the middle of being comforted by Futaba. The conversation quickly changes to the fight in class , with both Sensei and Nodoka commenting indirectly on the incident. Nodoka takes her leave after some back and forth, and Sensei takes a seat next to Futaba. Curious as to how someone like her ended up becoming best friends with Futaba, he pries into the depths of their friendship, and how much faith Futaba has in her. Futaba affirms that, while Nodoka comes off as conniving and secretive, she feels she's genuinely a good person, and wouldn't ever do something to actually hurt someone else. Sensei states he likes her too but has a hard time truly understanding her.",
