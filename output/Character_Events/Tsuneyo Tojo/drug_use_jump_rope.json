He remembers her mentioning kendo, and learns that she was the national junior kendo champion for three years. She stopped because she needed to take care of her father, and look after the family's noodle legacy. She mentions that her father is very strict about her not talking to boys, and so Sensei persuades her not to report their conversation.",
