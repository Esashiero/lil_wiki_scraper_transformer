Yuki says that she could probably do something to improve the building's electricity situation if they went upstairs. Sensei mentions that Tsuneyo's father doesn't want visitors, but Yuki says that since she knows Tsuneyo's father, it should be alright. Sensei can only agree, and the world gets weird again. When it returns to normal, Yuki asks if he's ready to go inside. Before they do, Tsuneyo appears and sends them back downstairs.",
