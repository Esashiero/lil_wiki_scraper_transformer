        "synopsis": "Catching a ride right before the park closes, Sensei and Tsuneyo enjoy the last ride of the night. As they get a view of the park, Sensei takes the time to appreciate the juxtaposition between how Tsuneyo was acting towards him a few days ago and how she is now. Being so high up, she’s a bit nervous, something Sensei takes advantage of to tease her – Causing her to angrily announce their date is over. Trying to be more genuine, he asks if she enjoyed herself today, which she confirms – Enjoying the distraction from the omnipresent fear she’s felt all day. He asks about what she’s afraid of again, but she remarks it’s just a feeling she has – A feeling that their current days are just a “calm before a storm”. Drawing upon a similar experience , he’s suddenly worried, something Tsuneyo picks up on immediately. He confides in her, sharing that he’s felt the same way all day. Tsuneyo’s happy to have someone to relate to, but a little upset Sensei didn’t bring it up earlier. He tries to explain himself, saying he’d been trying all day, but that she kept changing subject due to “the world” not wanting her to know. She tells him to try again, confessing that she’d been purposefully ignoring him to try and enjoy the facade of their date. Sensei quickly explains the situation – That they’re stuck in a looping school year, that he wants her to attend a slumber party at his place as a means to gain more knowledge, and that it might end with her seeing someone disintegrate or walking through an empty version of Kumon-mi. She asks him further questions, which include the “apocalypse”, how their memories are altered to fit current events and how this affected both of them so far, with Sensei answering to the best of his ability. All of this Tsuneyo takes extremely well, to both of their surprise. While unable to explain herself, everything he said just makes sense to her – Like she already heard all of this before. Either way, she quickly agrees to join the sleepover on the condition that, if she loses her memories of today, Sensei bring her back here. When he asks why, she tells him that she finally understands what everyone sees in him and, contrary to his claim, she doesn’t wants to forget that. Sensei agrees as the ride comes to an end and both go their separate ways.",
