Uta is surprised when Tsuneyo displays her knowledge of swearing , and tells Sensei that they ought to correct her, but Sensei says that it's too much fun. Tsuneyo picks up on it, however, and once Uta has left, Sensei gives her a partial explanation (telling her to ask Molly for the rest). Tsuneyo says that there are so many things she doesn't understand, and that she worries about the future when her father won't be there to explain things. Sensei points out that she has other people who will help her, and that it doesn't help to dwell on things that haven't happened yet. Before Sensei leaves, Tsuneyo thanks him for \"nurturing\" her.",
