        "synopsis": "As Sensei knocks on Room 6's door, he faintly makes out the sound of video games, which causes him to believe that Molly is home as well. Upon entering though, he finds only Tsuneyo present, who's busy practicing video games at Molly's request, specifically playing a game that Molly enthusiastically recommended before . During the conversation, Sensei \"blacks out\", coming to in front of Tsuneyo who's since taken a seat on her bed. Tsuneyo reveals to him that she's been trying to get into video games to help Molly with her recent heartbreak , having hoped that sharing an interest would help distract from the pain. However, Tsuneyo struggles to understand even basic controls and has started to consider other options. Sensei suggests she try other types of games, like the one the girls played back at the beach -- Tsuneyo remarks that it was during that game when Molly first began to \"crack\" . He then suggests board or card games, like Mahjong, but Tsuneyo turns that idea down as well. Feeling helpless, Tsuneyo ponders if maybe there's nothing she can do but wait for Molly to get better on her own. Sensei feels this is correct, believing most problems get better with time, and that Tsuneyo tiring herself out trying to help only increases the amount of \"net misery\". Hearing this, Tsuneyo gets sad, feeling that he is the one most in need of cheering up. She asks if there's anything she can do to make him feel better, but when he fails to give a suggestion, she suggests she teach him Kendo sometimes. Sensei's not particularly interested in the idea, and even less so when Tsuneyo displays a threatening level of confidence. Taking his leave, Sensei walks home, questioning if Tsuneyo doing something simple like playing games would do anything to help Molly, deciding that if her problems can be solved that simply, then maybe Molly's \"heartbreak\" isn't heartbreak at all.",
