Moreover, nobody has come into the restaurant all day. Sensei suggests that she just go and get some more green onions from a convenience store, rather than wait for the next delivery. After checking with her father, she agrees. As they walk through the old district, they talk about the people there, her father, and appreciating life's beauties while you can.",
