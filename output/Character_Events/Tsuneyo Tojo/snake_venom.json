She talks a little about the shop and its surrounding area, noting that most of the local people are poor, elderly, or both. Sensei orders a Green Dragon, and Tsuneyo again reveals her sheltered upbringing when she seems not to know that dragons are mythical. Occasionally, she makes an attempt at informal speech or telling jokes â€” Sensei says that he will help her improve.",
