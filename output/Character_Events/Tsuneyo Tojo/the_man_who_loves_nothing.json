Tsuneyo disagrees, telling Sensei that he just hates joy — she brings up his comment that there isn't really anything he loves. The shirt was a gift from her father, whom Tsuneyo clearly respects, although she says that does not defer to him in everything. She has also been learning from Molly , although the protective \"spell\" she acquired is not sufficient to repel a confessed pervert like Sensei. Eventually, Tsuneyo asks Sensei to show her the way to a 24-hour convenience store — she has only just learned that they exist.",
