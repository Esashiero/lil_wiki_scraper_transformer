Kaori resents not being able to add yet another job to her schedule, while Tsuneyo resents Kaori's strange terminology for ramen. They each consider Sensei to have betrayed them when he doesn't side with them, but both eventually sit down to eat. In the course of a strange conversation, they talk about what they each value, and Sensei concedes that there isn't really anything he actually loves .",
