Once she moves past that, they talk for a while about Tsuneyo's classmates, the shop, and Tsuneyo's future. They are interrupted when the power goes off. Tsuneyo goes upstairs to check that the machines keeping her father alive are getting backup power, but does not want Sensei to help â€” her father is adamant about remaining unseen. When the backup power comes on downstairs, everything is red, and Sensei isn't thinking normally. Tsuneyo returns after a length of time that Sensei can't accurately judge. She boxes his food (which seems to have had a smiley face drawn in it somehow) and he leaves.",
