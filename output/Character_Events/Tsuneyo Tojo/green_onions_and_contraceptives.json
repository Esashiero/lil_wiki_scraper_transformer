She finds the same products that Touka did, and inquires about them â€” Sensei's attempt to mislead her is foiled by Noriko. Noriko decides to close the store and accompany Sensei, Tsuneyo, and the onions back to Tojo Ramen. She mentions that her family also owns a restaurant, which Tsuneyo approves of. When they get to Tojo Ramen, Tsuneyo belatedly points out that it's closed now, and says goodbye.",
