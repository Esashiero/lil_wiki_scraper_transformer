Sensei arrives at the agreed upon date location, which happens to be the diner where Kaori works. Kaori also happens to be working, and was unaware of what a human date consists of. Kaori invites Sensei to eat together while on her lunch break, to which he agrees. Through the course of their lunch conversation, Kaori graciously awards Sensei the nicknames 'Hamber-bug', 'Hamburger-bug-burger-man-bug', before settling on 'friend'.",
