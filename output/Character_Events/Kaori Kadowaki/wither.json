        "synopsis": "Sensei calls Kaori to see if she's available, wanting to spend some time with her not in distress . When she answers, she informs him that she's currently lost after chasing a cat and, paradoxically, cannot use her phone's GPS because her phone is dead. After asking her to describe her location to him, Sensei realizes that she's on a familiar bridge in the Old District, and tells her to wait for him to arrive. Quickly locating her, Sensei warns Kaori that she shouldn't wander off like this too often, as he might not always be available to find her. Kaori apologizes for inconveniencing him but says she doesn't think that's true - That, even if he weren't trying to, he'd always find her. He finds this claim dubious, but isn't able to convince her otherwise and relents. The two stare up at the sky in silence for a while, before Kaori abruptly announces she's hungry. Not knowing of any other place, Sensei suggests they head to Tojo Ramen , much to her reluctance. The two arrive just before closing time, finding Tsuneyo and Yuki there already. Sitting down to order, Kaori inexplicably orders tori shio ramen, under the idea of ensuring the chickens used in the process won't go to waste. Tsuneyo is surprised by this, as that item was not on the menu, and she has never prepared it before. She tries to press Kaori for how she knows of the dish, with Kaori insisting she was only thinking of the chicken's well-being. The conversation between the two is abruptly cut off as the power goes out again . The emergency backup power kicks in, revealing that Kaori has inexplicably vanished. Yuki and Sensei rush outside to look for her as Tsuneyo goes to fix the power. In the end, neither of them can locate her and Sensei returns home.",
