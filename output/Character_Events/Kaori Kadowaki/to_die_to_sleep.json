While they walk, they talk about the reason for Kaori's familiarity with hospitals, but he doesn't get much more information than that it started with \"WHAPAM! BOOM! KCHHHHHH!!\". When they get to where the chickens should be, however, they find that they are too late. Kaori is upset, and Sensei quotes a poem that he thinks might explain death a bit better than he can. They talk about grief and loss, and Kaori mentions that \"the people she used to live with\" when she was young got hurt more than she did, and disappeared forever. Kaori takes a stuffed rabbit from a nearby table (which Sensei thinks is \"eerily out of place\"), and asks Sensei to take her somewhere where she can have a good time despite her loss.",
