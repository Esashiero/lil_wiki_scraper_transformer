        "synopsis": "Sensei knocks on Noriko ’s door the same time she leaves for a walk. She changes her plans, though, and invites him out for dinner since she wants to use this opportunity to talk about something. When questioned where they are going, she asks if he remembers the restaurant where he and Niki talked about her time after his disappearance . Sensei is surprised that she knows about that, but she explains that Niki told her since she has no one else to talk to and probably did it out of habit. Noriko proclaims that it’s her turn now and that she needs it so she can stop feeling like she chases a ghost. He assumes that this statement is related to his disappearance. He thinks that learning her past will be fine since nothing happened when he learned about Niki’s past, so, as long as it’s not about him, his mind shouldn’t suffer any damage. After thinking about how learning more about Noriko will bring him closer seeing her topless again , he suddenly stops thinking and they walk to the restaurant. Noriko realizes that her outfit isn’t suited for the location. After a short discussion about that, she wonders if the restaurant serves falafel, but Sensei doubts it. She intends to complain to the manager if this is the case, but he implores her to not do something that gives them too much attention due to their age gap. Kaori appears at their table to greet them and to take their order. To Sensei’s surprise the restaurant actually offers the vegan cuisine Noriko wants. Kaori already knows what Sensei wants and claims that she will serve him before he can say Loxosceles Reclusa, but when he does that repeatedly, she panics and leaves. Noriko, when Kaori says that he can enjoy devouring her hair, rambles on about it due to nervousness caused by their first real date. She tries to compose herself as she still has something she wants to talk about, which is her side of what happened after he disappeared. She tells him that, while he completely ghosted Niki, Sensei spent time with Noriko during his tutor sessions, which she saw as her personal castle and as an opportunity to get closer to him. During his time as a tutor multiple other girls came and went. One of these girls was Maya and, while Noriko liked her at first, she started to hate her when Sensei grew closer to Maya and moved away from her, both emotionally and physically. After he disappeared again, Noriko started looking for him and managed to find him, but an unknown girl was with him, who prevented her from getting him back. As her story goes on, Sensei’s mind flashes multiple times. The system crashes at some point, because the scene is not in sync with expectations, and tries to fix the connection. The system shows a distorted image of Noriko and asks if you want to phone. Once prompted the scene changes to a distorted sex scene with Noriko, then to a scene similar to his conversation with Maya during the first beach trip , Maya being both shocked and confused, before connecting back to reality after Noriko finished her story. Noriko wants to know if there is a chance that they can be together, even if it’s only in another timeline or world, and if her childhood dream isn’t dead yet. He assures her that it isn’t.",
