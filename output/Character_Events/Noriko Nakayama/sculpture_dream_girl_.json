She says that he was always good at teaching, and he is surprised when she mentions him tutoring Maya as well as herself. Sensei says that Maya hasn't told him anything except that Noriko will \" ruin everything \" for him. Noriko says that if there's anything he doesn't like about her, she'll happily change it (except getting rid of her knife). Before he goes, Sensei gets her phone number.",
