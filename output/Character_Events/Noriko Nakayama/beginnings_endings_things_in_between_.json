Noriko says that she wouldn't want to be caught doing anything by Ami , but realises that she wouldn't care if it was Maya , because Maya is a \"really bad person\" and a big part of why Sensei \"disappeared\" last time. Sensei tells her that some of the things she says make her sound crazy, and she says that she loves him so much that her \"brain broke\". She wants to do something with him now, but before anything happens, Ami sends a warning that she and Maya are about to return. Before Noriko leaves, Sensei asks her to try not to worry about Maya.",
