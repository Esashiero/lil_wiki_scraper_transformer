        "synopsis": "Deciding he needs to inform Noriko about the newest developments between him and Niki , Sensei gives Noriko a call, hoping to make plans with her. Upon dialing, he's confused to hear Kirin 's voice on the other end, who quickly informs him that Noriko is away at the moment and that the two of them are currently away from the dorms. He asks when she'll be back, mentioning that he needs to hurt Noriko’s feelings yet again. Kirin offers to send their location but tries to chastise Sensei for how he treats Noriko. He ignores this by preemptively hanging up on her, only for her to send a lot of rude text messages. After getting their location via text, Sensei makes his way over to the address, surprised to find the two in a familiar hotel. He quickly confirms the two aren't here on a date and catches up with Noriko, who awkwardly thanks him for Christmas , much to his confusion. The three go back and forth, getting wrapped up in the atmosphere of the place before Sensei puts an end to it by taking a seat on the bed with them. As Sensei gets comfortable, he decides he needs to lead the conversation to prevent any more of Kirin’s mischief, but she reveals that this is the same room she invited Sensei to back during winter before he has the chance to intervene. Noriko is shocked to hear about this, asking Sensei if he knew that coming in. He confirms he didn't and that he wouldn’t have no matter which room they had that day. While Noriko is relieved, Kirin is offended, something Sensei finds odd since their visit not being special or memorable was the whole point. Flustered, Kirin tries to derail the conversation by pushing Noriko to further her relationship with Sensei. Noriko's eventually pressured into sitting on Sensei's lap but refuses to push for anything else, enjoying their current dynamic and not wanting to rush things just because of her excitement. She does, however, offer to pay him back for Christmas – An idea Sensei's for, but feels needs to wait until they talk about him and Niki. The rest of the night is spent with the girls constantly bantering with one another, and Sensei returns home once their time at the hotel runs out and after confirming with Kirin that she'll be there for Noriko, even if he cannot be.",
