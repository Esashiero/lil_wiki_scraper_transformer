        "synopsis": "Sensei and Ami are on their way out of school. Molly tried to speak with him about the incident at the Halloween party , but since he can’t remember what happened , he decides to avoid her until he knows how to deal with it. Ami realizes that something’s off and asks if Molly is the reason for that, but Sensei assures her that he’s just tired, so she recommends him to got to bed once they’re back home. He asks her if there’s anything he could do to change her feelings for him, but she assures him that there isn’t anything that could change her love for him. Their conversation is interrupted by Noriko who apologizes to Sensei for her immature outburst . Sensei doesn’t understand why she’s the one apologizing, considering that she didn’t do anything wrong. He considers apologizing to her, but he abandons that thought since there’s no reason to apologize for being intimate with her sister and it’s her fault for getting upset about it. Noriko continues by stating that she doesn’t mind when he spends his time with other girls and that she wants to get stronger for his sake. Amy decides to give both of them time and heads home, demanding that he comes home once they’re done. Once she’s gone, Sensei tells Noriko that she doesn’t need to apologize, but she immediately disagrees with him. She explains that she broke her promise of not getting in the way of other girls in their pursuit of Sensei’s affection. As a result, she made a new promise and wants to fight for him on equal grounds. She acknowledges how embarrassing she behaves and begs him to accept her apology so she can stop. They are interrupted by an unknown woman who heard Noriko’s apology from afar, decided to take a look and is now cheering for her. Sensei asks for her name and she introduces herself as Imani , the new substitute teacher for Wakana ’s class. After he makes her leave, Sensei tells Noriko that seeing her being serious was weird, but she explains that it was necessary to reaffirm her feelings for him. He realize that, despite trying to act mature, Noriko’s still a teenager, meaning that she seeks for forgiveness rather than letting things take a negative turn. He accepts her apology, which surprises her since she thought that he lied to her when he said that she didn’t need to, but he explains that there was no reason for him to lie. She requests from him to walk her home, which he accepts. Sensei waits for her to get changed but is surprised when she gets back 30 seconds later. He notices that both of them are outside and Noriko, who holds his arm, tells him that they left school ten minutes ago. Sensei is confused by the sudden change of scenery but still walks her home.",
