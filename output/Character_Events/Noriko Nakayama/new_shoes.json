Noriko seems to know more about Sensei's early life than Ami does, and Ami doesn't know whether to be mad or impressed that he once dated Niki Nakayama . Noriko manages to convince Ami that she's nice, although Ami still isn't fully accepting of her. Maya unexpectedly arrives at the house, and everyone agrees that it would be best if Maya and Noriko don't meet — as such, Noriko and Sensei hide while Ami invents a reason why Maya should accompany her back outside.",
