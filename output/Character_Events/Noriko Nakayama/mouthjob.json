They talk about her job, and she mentions the possibility of going to work at the same maid cafe as Ami and Uta . She thinks she would be able to \"bring both the childhood friend trope and the little sister trope to the table\", and discovers that it's harder to get her mind off Sensei being her Onii-chan than she thought. Noriko also asks Sensei if there's any chance of Nodoka moving into Sensei's class.",
