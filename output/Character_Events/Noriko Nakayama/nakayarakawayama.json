He is surprised to learn that they are in the old district, and Noriko wonders if some of his old memories might be present subconsciously. They talk about Sensei's teaching style (which was apparently much more diligent before), Noriko's school successes and employment, whether or not Sensei will get his memories back, and hypothetical futures for them together",
