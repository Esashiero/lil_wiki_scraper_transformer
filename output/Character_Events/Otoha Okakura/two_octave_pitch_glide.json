        "synopsis": "Sensei and Otoha reach Niki ’s basement and Sensei sees why it was described to him as sketchy. Niki notices him and, to his annoyance, immediately figures out why he’s here. She doesn’t mind his presence but demands that he doesn’t disturb her lesson. After he interrupts their idle chatter, Niki decides to improve Otoha’s vocal stamina while Sensei takes a seat on her couch. A short while later, Sensei gets a phone call from someone and accepts it. Otoha gets annoyed, but Niki wants her to focus on her practice and includes Sensei’s distraction in her training. She starts singing while Sensei has a conversation with whoever called him, who turns out to be Rin . She was wondering why he hasn’t arrived at the cafe yet, but notices Otoha singing in the background. He explains that he accompanied her to her vocal lessons, makes a joke about Otoha’s parents being there as well and how they make fun of her. Rin laughs it off and, after she remembered that Niki is his ex, wants to know if he can organize a double date for them. He doesn’t mind asking them after she explains that she needs to get out and do something. Rin has to end the call due to an increase in customers and hangs up. Sensei calls her by name, which gets Otoha’s attention. Niki demands that she concentrates on her practice and the lesson goes on with Sensei deciding to stay quiet now. Otoha makes a mistake after a while and Niki gets behind her, wraps her arms around her waist and presses her hands on her stomach to demonstrate her where her singing voice should be coming from. Otoha gets more and more embarrassed by her direct approach, her face gets more and more flushed and, once Niki calls her out for that, flees upstairs to cool down. Sensei asks if she’s aware of the real reason Otoha was blushing. She knows the reason but didn’t say it out loud, because Otoha would never come back if she did and she wants to help her further her talent. Sensei compliments her resolve as Otoha comes back in. Before they can continue their lesson, though, Sensei decides to tell them about Rin’s request for a double date, which both of them agree to. The girls continue their lesson while Sensei watches some muted videos on his phone.",
