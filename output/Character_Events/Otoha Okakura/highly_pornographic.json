She is taking advantage of being on her own to eat what she likes, but their conversation on balanced meals is interrupted by a call from Otoha's mother. To assuage suspicions that Otoha is with a boy, Sensei has to pretend to be the TV, but chooses to do so in a way that nearly gets Otoha in trouble. She tells him not to do that sort of thing, since her permission to be there is precarious enough as it is. The TV goes back to normal, and they spend a while watching it.",
