Otoha doesn't know what it was all about, but speculates that Nodoka was just seeing how far she could push without Sensei snapping back. Otoha wants Sensei's advice about Rin , asking what sort of person she is and what Sensei would do in her place. He suggests that her questions can only be answered by spending more time with Rin, which Otoha says she will do. Rin comes down to see what they're doing, and Sensei decides that he should head home.",
