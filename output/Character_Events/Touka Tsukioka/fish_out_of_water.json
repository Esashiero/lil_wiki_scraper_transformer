She proposes to ignore Yasu , who is sitting and staring at the wall, and also mentions having had little luck talking to other girls in the dorm â€” Sensei encourages her to keep trying. Touka is still unhappy about having to live with Yasu, and thinks that Sensei is asking too much of her. She tells him that her desire for \"special treatment\" arises from being genuinely confused in an unfamiliar environment, not from selfishness or conceit. Sensei acknowledges her point.",
