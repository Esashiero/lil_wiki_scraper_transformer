Touka is surprised that people (including some of her classmates) live in a place like this, but is pleased that Sensei is showing her the real world. As Touka is giving food to some of the homeless people there, she and Sensei suddenly find themselves in the convenience store where Noriko works â€” Touka says that it was Sensei's suggestion, but he doesn't remember it. After Touka makes an embarrassing mistake while browsing the store, they depart.",
