        "synopsis": "Sensei knocks on the door to Room 9, playing a quick prank on Touka before he's invited in. As he opens the door, he ruminates over the inevitability of him and Touka drifting apart due to their clashing statuses. Upon entering, he finds her dressed up, which she explains as being due to a sudden business meeting that Tsubasa called her to the Estate for. She initially intended to arrive alone but, feeling pressured due to his sudden appearance, she invites him along. After learning the meeting has nothing to do with their talk from the other day, he assures her he can leave if need be but she insists it's not a problem – Stipulating that he stays in one of the estate’s rooms while she's busy. The two arrive at the Tsukioka Estate and begin the walk to Tsubasa's meeting room. Along the way, Sensei further ruminates on the differences between him and Touka, pondering if the kindness she gives him is genuine or just another form of the formality that her family instilled her with. As Touka quips about how childish Sensei often acts, he points out how uncomfortably mature she always seems. This causes her to reflect on her upbringing, reminiscing on the endless amount of lessons on etiquette, hobbies, and praise that was pushed onto her from the moment of birth – These things so drastically shaped who she is that she struggles to even hold resentment towards her parents for restricting her freedom, as they've caused her to be incapable of imagining a life outside of the family. Sensei asks if such a restrictive and set future makes her bored, and while she admits that it does at times, joining his class gives her enough excitement to balance it out. Touka suddenly stops walking, flashing him a smile reminiscent of Tsubasa. When he points this out, she asks if she needs to worry about being perceived as \"unoriginal\" by him due to the similarities between them. While he confirms that there are commonalities between them, he reminds her there's plenty she expressed that her mother never has and probably never will express as she's so closed-off. She admits that a trait she and her mother share is their dedication to the family's status, though Sensei notes the only exception for Touka seems to be arranged marriages . A bit embarrassed, Touka clarifies that while she is uncomfortable with the idea, she'd do so in a heartbeat if it benefits her family, but since there are no suitors that could do that, she enjoys the privilege of being able to marry someone she loves. She is unsure if she would use it, though, since while she feels confident in being a good mother, she doubts that she could be a good wife, especially if she ends up with someone who’s as exhausting as Sensei. As the two start to banter, Tsukasa suddenly runs up to the two and interrupts them when Touka makes a joke on her expense.",
