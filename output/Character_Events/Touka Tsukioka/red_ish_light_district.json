        "synopsis": "After leaving the subway, Sensei and the Tsukioka’s find themselves in the entertainment district he visited on his date . The girls are impressed that they found something this spectacular and try to figure out how reasonable it is for them to be here, but Sensei assures them that they’re save during the day and also decides to visit this place at night one day. They decide to look for something to do and Sensei has a place in mind. Touka wonders why he was here before, but answers her own question when she remembers what she heard about this district, while Tsubasa is worried about that place not being appropriate for Tsukasa to visit. He assures them that the place is fine since it’s an arcade he visited with one of his students. Touka and Tsubasa think that this student was Molly or Chika respectively, but he tells them that it was Rin , which makes Tsubasa feel stupid while Touka isn’t surprised. The girls agree to visit the arcade and Sensei, after he remembered its name, leads the way. They arrive at the arcade and Touka gives him a snarky compliment for his choice. He wonders who taught her sarcasm, and she explains that she picked it up during their time together. She decides to check out one of the arcade machines, Tsubasa wants to order something from the bar and Tsukasa inspects one of the tabletop games. Meanwhile, Sensei chooses who he wants to join first.",
