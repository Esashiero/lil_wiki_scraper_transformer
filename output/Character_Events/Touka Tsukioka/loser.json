She says that although she sometimes makes mistakes, she is still dismissed as a stereotypical rich girl even when she has done absolutely nothing. She acknowledges that her problems are minor compared to those of some of her classmates, but says that she is still \"a real girl with real feelings\", and wishes that she had real friends. She feels a little better for having said so, and wants to keep talking for a while. Sensei asks about any hardships Touka might have experienced despite her background â€” she talks about the fact that her father wanted a male heir, and about the expectation that she marry.",
