At Tojo Ramen, Tsuneyo has already corrected any misunderstandings that might have arisen from Yuki overhearing a previous conversation . Sensei asks why Yuki wants to check up on Yumi, and although Yuki admits that she wasn't a great parent, it's still nice to know that her daughter hasn't made the same mistakes as she did at that age. Sensei tells Yuki about Yumi's job interview , about Chika and Chinami , and about Yumi's TV resale \"business\". Sensei asks if Yuki wants to see Yumi again — Yuki says that she'd be happy to do so if Yumi wanted it, but she isn't asking Sensei to make it happen, and there's no guarantee that Yuki won't relapse into the same problems that alienated them to begin with.",
