        "synopsis": "Having recently been informed that Yuki and Yumi are on speaking terms again, Sensei dials Yuki's number in hopes of getting closer to her and wanting to see if she noticed some kind of change in her daughter that could be attributed to the reset. Picking up the phone, Yuki reveals she's got the night off and invites Sensei over to her new apartment, albeit on the condition he doesn't brag about his own house. Soon arriving at Yuki's new apartment, which he quickly realizes is in the same complex as and right next to Imani 's apartment, Sensei takes a seat next to her on the couch and the two crack open a few cans to sip while they talk. Yuki mentions that it's been a long time since she's hung out alone with a guy, with Sensei quickly seizing on the opportunity to flirt. She repeatedly repels his attempts, claiming he's far too young for someone as old as her to get with. She quips that it's odd the two of them are friends at all, what with Sensei's constant somber attitude and desire to continuously pry into her “sad backstory”. She tries to get some details about his life from him, but Sensei excuses himself by saying he can't remember much. While she wants to know the reason for that, he says that he can’t explain it and tries to move on. The conversation drifts once Sensei continues to flirt, asking Yuki about what sorts of guys she even likes. Having never thought about it before, Yuki's unable to give much of an answer, copping out by saying someone like her sounds good enough, adding that it'd also be nice to have someone who won't take advantage of her too. Sensei's jokingly hurt that her type is the complete opposite of him, with Yuki teasing him by saying his personality's fine but his mental age is far too young – Besides, his type doesn't seem to be girls like her anyway. Sensei presses his point about finding her attractive, with Yuki telling him he's free to “prove it”, assuming that he will change his mind once he gets a closer look. When he starts to make a move, though, Yuki's composure starts to fall apart as she realizes how serious he is. Before anything happens, a knock on the door breaks the moment up, and Yumi calls out from the other side, having been invited earlier.",
