She says that given her situation at the time, the opportunity Yumi's father presented seemed too good to turn down, but it's still the biggest regret of her life. She also tells him how Yumi was conceived, but tells him not to repeat any of it to Yumi. Sensei informs her that when he told Yuki about their previous meeting, it didn't go well â€” Yuki isn't surprised, but thanks him for trying.",
