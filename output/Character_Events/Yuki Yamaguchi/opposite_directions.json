Open arriving, the two briefly discuss the increased business Sara has had, before Kaori joins the two of them, having been asked to help as well. As she leaves, Yuki and Sensei discuss their and Yumi's shared past. Yuki admits she's glad that Sensei is as nice a person as he is, which he tries to refute before being shut down. He's forced into helping her pass out fliers, which he loses interest in after a few minutes.",
