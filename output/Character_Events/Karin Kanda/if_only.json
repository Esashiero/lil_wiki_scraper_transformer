She eventually hands over some cookies that she made for Sensei , although she tells him that she just happened to have extra, that they're probably bad anyway, and that he should only deliver his opinion of them later by text message. She hints that she wants to have lunch with him, although she flinches at the word \"date\". They go to the Koi Cafe, where Molly is annoyed to see another girl (and a \"well-endowed\" one at that) being added to Sensei's harem.",
