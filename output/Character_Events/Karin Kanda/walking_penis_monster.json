While trying to tell Sensei that he is a good teacher, she becomes embarrassed again, and keeps digging herself deeper. They talk about why she gets flustered around him, and Sensei privately wonders if there is more to it than just nervousness around boys in general. They talk a little about Karin's possible futures, but she gets embarrassed again, and declines his suggestion that they get dinner together.",
