He suggests that it would be easier for her to just text him. He asks if they can go somewhere warmer, and Karin shows him a place. Sensei asks about her early life, and she tells him that her oldest memory involves her sister â€” he isn't surprised. Karin wants to keep improving her ability to talk to him, and will try to summon the courage to arrange something via text message.",
