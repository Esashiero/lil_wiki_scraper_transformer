Before Miku can propose a second adventure, she is called away, leaving Sensei and Karin to talk. She tells him that one of the reasons she likes having him as a coach (even though he barely does anything) is that he doesn't expect more out of her than than he does out of anyone else. She likes \"being in the middle\", rather than being pressured to be the best. She can't talk about it with most people, and especially not with Kirin , but does feel comfortable talking to Sensei now. Miku returns and leads them off on more adventures.",
