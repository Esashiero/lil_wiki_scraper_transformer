Her part of the dorm room contains a lot of tools, and she reminds him that making things is one of her hobbies. She offers to make him something sometime to show him that she's worth his time, and he asks what she means by that last bit. She tells him that it's important to be good for something, and to make a positive contribution to the world, but also admits that she is \"all talk\" and doesn't see things through.",
