        "synopsis": "Sensei gets woken up by a phone call and while he tries to ignore it, he is forced to answer it when he gets a second call. Io has news for him, but since he wants to get back to sleep, he hangs up. When she calls a third time, he accepts his fate and listens to what she wants. She doesn’t have to work today and, after Uta advised her to take the initiative, wants to spend time with him. She also has something she wants to share with him, so he invites her over before going back to sleep until she arrives. Two hours later, Sensei gets woken up by Io ringing at the door. He lets her in and she excitedly inspects his home. She says that they will be busy with what she has planned, though, and shows him a copy of 1999 PC Classic, Rollercoaster Tycoon. Sensei is underwhelmed by her plan, but she wants to experience the amusement park with him and chose this as a cheaper alternative. He tries to sneakily suggest something he would rather do instead, but when she calls him out for being creepy, he gives up and agrees to play with her. Once she enters his room, she is overjoyed to see that the robot she made is actually there while her wardrobe is somewhere else in the house, which still satisfies her since nothing she made landed in the trash. She installs the game on his computer and they start playing for a few hours. He is surprised to learn that she likes killing people in simulator games and she claims that she has to do it or she would be in jail. Since they played for a while, she offers him to do something else. He has no concrete plans but thought that they could do something more intimate. She gets nervous and, after another conversation about her usual behavior, she asks what his definition of intimate is, to which he answers that his definition depends on hers. She wants to cuddle with him but is nervous due to them being completely alone this time and fears that he will abandon her if she screws it up, but he assures her that if he wanted to abandon her, he would have done it already and will be there for her now. After a moment of embarrassed silence, she lies on his bed begging him to accompany her. He lies behind her and while she gets comfortable in his company, he tries to justify that he can go further with her since she is just like him and wants the same thing he wants. His hand finds its way to her lower leg and make their way to her shorts as Io gets concerned about what he’s doing. After a flash, Io has left the bed out of fear, tells him that she actually has to work today and quickly leaves his house while Sensei, confused by what happened, goes back to sleep.",
