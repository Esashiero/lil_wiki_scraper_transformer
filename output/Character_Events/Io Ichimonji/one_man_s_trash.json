She is having second thoughts about doing so, wondering whether it's really ready or whether he will think it's dumb. Sensei says that he wants to see it and that it isn't a big deal, but she says that for her, it's like giving away a part of herself. Eventually she reveals a painted wooden robot . She is pleased that Sensei likes him, and invites him to choose his name. Noriko and Kirin arrive, and Kirin is less complementary about the robot. Io leaves; Sensei follows. He tells her that he still likes her gift, and wants to go with her rather than stay with Noriko and Kirin.",
