Having a space of her own is also good, since she doesn't feel that the guest room she lives in at her aunt's bathhouse is really hers. She suggests having a revolution and declaring the dorms an independent republic, so they wouldn't even have to go to school at all. They talk a bit about plans for the future and Io's dislike of social interaction before Io goes back into her dorm.",
