        "synopsis": "Sensei finds himself hanging out with Io during club practice, this time finding shelter in the Tea Ceremony Club's room . As the two sit there in silence, he reminds himself of the things that make her uncomfortable , telling himself that he will learn to respect these differences as part of his plan to be a better person – Which means that Io too can get better, so long as she maintains the ability to adapt. Io speaks up, reminding him of just how much she likes him . She tells him how safe being with him makes her feel, which allows her to speak her mind without the fear of being judged. Taking advantage of that freedom, she confesses she dreamt of him last night and asks if he ever dreams of her as well. He tells her that he doesn't dream often, and when he does they're often incomprehensible , but promises to keep track if she ever shows up in them. Taking note of this unexpected kindness, she asks if he's being gentler with her due to now feeling off around her, offering a hug to help alleviate his wariness. He turns the offer down, saying their current dynamic's perfectly fine. This prompts Io to point out his incredibly formal speech, questioning him on why he does that, or if someone taught him to speak like that. After a failed attempt on both ends to say something more casual and humorous, the conversation shifts to the upcoming Dorm Wars , where Sensei asks if she's actually going to participate this year. Io confirms she will and expresses an uncharacteristic amount of excitement about the event, both because of the contest and the fact she gets to compete against Miku . He sees why she'd be excited, especially considering her and Miku's relationship . Seeing the opportunity, he decides to lecture her about sharing her medication with Miku, much to Io's disappointment. He pushes her away from him and bluntly asks why she's still giving Miku doses of her medicine, a question he barely gets out before she bluntly answers she's doing such because no one else will bother helping. Miku's been dealing with untreated PTSD for a long time now, and Io knows that trying to live a normal life without treatment is nearly impossible, especially if it’s as severe as hers and is triggered by something that can’t be prevented. Sensei retorts that dealing out medication without professional help can be dangerous, which she counters by arguing that professionals would take forever to figure out what Miku needs, while she already has, that Miku’s life has improved by leaps and bounds because of her and that leaving her on her own again could kill her, which is why she can’t and won't abandon her. Realizing just how much Io cares about Miku, he decides not to interfere with her treatment but does ask Io to try and guide her to more professional help. This prompts Io to ask Sensei about his own problems, which he disregards. When she tries to press the topic more, he deflects.",
