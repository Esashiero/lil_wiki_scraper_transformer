She tells him that she's starting to like the time they spend together, even if most of it is just her cryptically hinting at her backstory. Sensei suggests that she tell him more about herself, given her past comments about hating secrets, but Io says that even though secrets are bad, they exist for a reason. She doesn't want to talk about how she came to live at the bathhouse, only saying that she \"woke up and walked here\", but does say that it's not a bad place to be, even if she's \"just a visitor\".",
