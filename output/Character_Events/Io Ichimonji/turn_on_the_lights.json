Yuki thinks that Io should make more of an effort to get along with people â€” Io disagrees and doesn't want to talk about it. However, Io is unexpectedly keen to exchange phone numbers with Sensei when the topic arises. After Yuki has gone, Io shows Sensei to the bath, saying if she talks to him (without looking at him) while he is warm and relaxed, he will be more inclined to put up with her. They talk about Yuki's past, about the desire to be forgiven, and about coping mechanisms.",
