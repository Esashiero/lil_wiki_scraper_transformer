        "synopsis": "Maya makes Sensei carry a box again. As before , he isn't allowed to know what is in it, although she says that the answer is actually \"rather boring\". After making the delivery, Maya acknowledges that Sensei must find her frustratingly hard to read. He says that, rather than wanting to read her thoughts, he'd like her to tell him what she's thinking — this surprises her. When he off-handedly calls the box he carried \"stupid\", Maya tells him not to call it that, and he apologises. She says that it's fine, and that she \"can only imagine how frustrating it must be to be forced into a role you never wanted, without any explanation as to why you’re performing it\" — which Sensei thinks is going a bit far when he just carried a box. Maya buys Sensei a drink — just like last time.",
