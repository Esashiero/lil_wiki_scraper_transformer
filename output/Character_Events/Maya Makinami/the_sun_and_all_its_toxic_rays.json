        "synopsis": "Tired from the summer heat, Sensei decides to spend some time at the shrine, in hopes of finally talking to Maya about what happened between them on Christmas . Upon reaching the shrine, he finds her to be just as miserable about the heat as he is, insulting him in a way that reminds him of their earlier encounters at the shrine . As he begins to broach the topic of their relationship, Ayane suddenly sprints over. Maya soon reveals that due to the confirmation that Ayane will be a permanent member of the “Rooftop Apocalypse Squad”, her frequent visits at the shrine and her growing obsession with her, she decided to make Ayane an apprentice shrine maiden so she can be useful during her visits. In addition to this, it also serves as formal proof of her place within the trio and allows the two to make plans regarding future resets more often, as well as share their various theories. Ayane wants to know if she will make everyone that manages to make it to the roof an apprentice, but Maya is still convinced that Ayane was a fluke and that it won’t happen again. Now with an added motivation to induct more people into the group, Sensei also wants to know what they'll do if it does happen again. Maya says they'll cross that bridge when they get to it, but thinks they should come up with a general plan to handle this next cycle. She and Ayane both decided that, like last time , they should test a theory that came up during the end of the last cycle for the duration of the current one – In this case if they can make others aware of the resets. They advise him to keep an eye out for anyone who might display similar levels of awareness that Yumi and Tsuneyo did, as catching them up on how resets work earlier might reveal something they previously missed. Sensei suggests to check if both of them have some lingering memories, but Maya already approached Tsuneyo, who doesn’t seem to have any, and didn’t want too check on Yumi, so Sensei decides to do it. Suddenly, Ayane suggests that the three of them try and get Ami onto their side. The suggestion confuses Sensei, with Ayane explaining that in addition to curbing Ami's growing suspicions of them, she's more likely to believe them than anyone else. Maya turns down the idea, briefly recounting several decades or centuries worth of attempts to do the same, all to no avail; Each attempt ended with Ami becoming strangely mad. Ayane drops the idea upon seeing how uncomfortable Maya is, and the three agree to their previous plan. Now with a goal in mind, Sensei takes his leave, escaping the heat and his own impossible desires.",
