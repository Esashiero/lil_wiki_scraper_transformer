        "synopsis": "After a regular day at school, Ayane , Ami , Maya , and Sensei are walking home together, this time with an unexpected shower of rain. While it had previously been rare, there are more expected downpours to come in the following days, with Sensei mostly optimistic about this change in his life. Similarly, Maya has begun to more outwardly express concern for him, something Sensei starts to wonder about before having his thoughts interrupted by Ami suddenly speaking up. The group turns to their side to find that, for some reason, Kaori is standing motionlessly in the rain without an umbrella. The girls, sans Maya, try to snap her out of her weird trance, but she only comes to once Sensei calls out to her. Coming to, Kaori rushes over to the two of them, seeming to have not even realized it was raining in the first place. Sensei asks why she's out and about at all, with Kaori explaining that she was handing out fliers to drum up sales for her workplace. When the girls note she has no fliers on her, Kaori believes herself to be done, and prepares to return to her workplace. Ami stops her, though, offering to have the group walk back with her as she doesn't seem to have an umbrella. Maya, who's quickly grown exhausted by Kaori's distinctive way of speaking, is reluctant to take the detour, eventually being convinced when Sensei offers to pay for her while they're there. Arriving at the same cafe where the group celebrated Ami's birthday , Ayane offers to pay for Ami's meal and the two take a seat at a private booth. Meanwhile, Maya walks away and sits down in the middle of the group discussion, leaving Sensei to chase after her. He takes the seat across from her, with Maya getting upset due to Ami's increasing suspicions that there's something between the two of them. Sensei reassures her that Ayane's currently distracting her, though is using the opportunity to ask her questions about the apocalypse despite the group's decision not to involve her . Maya worries that Ayane might ruin things between them all, with Sensei reminding her that she's been wrong before . Kaori quickly comes over to the table, taking Sensei's order before rushing back to the kitchen, having completely ignored Maya. While at first confused, when Kaori is called back again and continues to not hear her, Sensei is forced to request the menu himself, leaving Maya frustrated. The group enjoy their meals, with Sensei believing that even if Maya ended up being able to communicate with Kaori, she'd have probably failed.",
