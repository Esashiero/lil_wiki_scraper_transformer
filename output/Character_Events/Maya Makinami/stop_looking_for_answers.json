They seem concerned for him, since it's cold and Sensei (to his surprise) is soaking wet. Maya wants to talk to Sensei alone, which seems to make Ayane suspicious. Maya apologises for the recent incident , and says that she is glad he didn't accept her offer (which wouldn't have worked in any case). She still hopes that he can be separated from Noriko, and Sensei again asks why. She points out that when she tried to tell him anything, he passed out. However, she does say that she was wrong about Sensei changing, and about everything being part of a fixed cycle â€” too much has happened for that to be true. She tells him again that he \"probably\" is the original Sensei, and says that although he should stop looking for answers, she would tell him more if she could.",
