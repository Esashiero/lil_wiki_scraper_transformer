After getting her meal, she tells Sensei that he is \"changing too quickly\", and doing things that he isn't supposed to. She says that something confusing will happen soon. She asks him what he thinks would happen if the repeating cycles she talked about converged into one, leaving him to handle the memories of every past lifetime at once. He says that he can't know unless it happens, and after she expresses surprise that he didn't call her crazy or joke about it, she says that wasn't a horrible answer.",
