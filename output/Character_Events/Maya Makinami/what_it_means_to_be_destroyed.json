Sensei asks what good it does to keep things secret from him, and Maya says that the more he remembers, the less likely it is for him to continue existing. They argue about whether Maya's policy of \"just... keeping the world moving\" is really living or not. Maya buys him a drink from a vending machine â€” just like last time. They talk more about Noriko, and Maya confirms Noriko's claim that Sensei used to tutor Maya as well. Maya says that she will keep trying to convince Sensei to stop seeing Noriko.",
