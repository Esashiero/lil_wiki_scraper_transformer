He laments the two people who hate him the most being in the hallway on the same evening, to which Maya's response is effectively the simple fact that the day happens to be a Monday. Sensei attempts to ask her what she's doing for the evening, only for her to launch into another tirade of plainly-delivered insults, before demanding he never speak of their conversation with anyone and promptly heading into her room. He leaves to head home and go to bed.",
