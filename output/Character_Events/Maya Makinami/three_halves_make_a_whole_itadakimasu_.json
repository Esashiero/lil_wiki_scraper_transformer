        "synopsis": "As they leave the house, Sensei realizes that he has no idea where the festival is held and Maya tells him that it’s in a distant part of Kumon-mi he will never visit again after this. While he’s lost in thoughts, a flash occurs and he finds himself at the festival. He feels a little nostalgic, even though he doesn’t know why, so he assumes he visited before, but when he asks her, she avoids giving an answer to prevent his mind from breaking down. Maya demands his credit card and wants him to get everything he can find from the west half of the festival and to bring it to the gazebo at the entrance. He stalls at first, but once she gets frustrated, he caves in and hands it to her. While he looks for food, he gets called out by a brown-haired girl offering him a watermelon. After a few innuendos about melons, she offers him two melons for the price of one, but insists that he pays 6 million pesos. He offers to pay 1000 Yen instead, which she accepts. He wants to know her name, but she refuses to give it to him and thinks that he flirts with her since she reminds him of his students. He hasn’t told her about his profession, though, and confronts her with that. She hands him the melons he bought in response and Sensei suddenly finds himself near the gazebos. Maya is already there and has a wide assortment of food placed in front of her. He feels sorry for Ami since her entire college fund was sacrificed for this, but Maya isn’t worried about that as no one will be getting to college any time soon. He’s still surprised how she can eat this much and she explains it with her non-existent growth. He presents the watermelons and Maya is overjoyed, because, according to other stall owners, there weren’t any. Sensei serves everything else he got, including a living squid, which she doesn’t want to eat while it’s alive. Sensei doesn’t want to kill it and didn’t think she would ask him for that. She reminds him that she wanted him to kill Noriko , but he awaits the day they make up. She doesn’t want to hear it and decides to eat her feast. Once finished everything else, she enjoys her watermelon with a genuine smile while Sensei wasn’t able to finish his ramen because of that. She finishes her meal and wants to walk around with him before visiting the shrine.",

            "The part with the watermelon only occurs when Sensei has an intimate relationship with Ami. Otherwise the scene will be replaced with him just getting everything he can find and brings it directly to Maya. She finishes and they walk around the festival without any further discussions.",
            "If Sensei additionally has a relationship with Sara , the scene with the brown-haired girl will be extended further, since he remembers meeting her after leaving the bar in The Place She Falls Asleep At Night ."
