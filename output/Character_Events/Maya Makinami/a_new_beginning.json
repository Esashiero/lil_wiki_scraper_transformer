Maya is surprised to see him there, and when he can't explain why he came, she concludes that he's not the real Sensei. He denies it, but is unable to answer a question about Ami 's birthday, which Maya takes as confirmation. Maya then ribs Sensei's age several times, before attempting to explain to him that it's not uncommon for people to be \"reborn\" like that, although she is unsure why Sensei was reborn into this world, or why he took over an existing body rather than get a new one. She is not interested in getting to know the new Sensei any more than the old one, but she does agree that it would be simpler not to tell the other girls about his secret.",
