        "synopsis": "Sensei arrives in the first floor dorm hallway and knocks on Maya 's door. He elects to remain silent in case Ami is inside, but his efforts are rendered moot when Ami calls out to him from the other side of the door. He says it's him, and Ami overrides Maya's protests to invite him in. Sensei walks into the room and greets Ami warmly, while Maya laments in her exasperation on the other side of the newly-setup kotatsu. Ami asks him what he's been up to, and he has a quick chat about his day-to-day while Maya stews on the other side, and as he sits down, Ami has to force Maya to leave things be instead of giving Sensei a death glare. Sensei immediately turns to Maya and prepares to talk to her when Ami asks if he's comfortable. He points out having a kotatsu is redundant in the middle of summer, and Ami uses that retort as a chance to take a stab at Maya for her sudden shift in behavior. Sensei asks if the girls are studying or anything, and Maya points out that with Sensei's methods, there really isn't much need to study. Maya becomes more derisive again, and Ami becomes annoyed, threatening Maya that she'll leave the room as punishment for her sudden mood swing. When Maya continues to be derisive, Ami decides she'll do exactly that, and despite Maya's animated protests, has Sensei promise not to do anything bad before stepping out to go take a shower. Sensei turns to Maya and immediately tries to find out why Maya's mood has changed so abruptly when he hasn't even done anything wrong yet. The two get into another debate over Maya's philosophy and deterministic outlook amid Maya questioning why Sensei must keep pestering her when nothing good will come of it, and eventually she gets up to stand by the desk. Sensei, having thought she was going to leave, stands up as well. Maya seems slightly less abrasive when Sensei comes to the conclusion about her relationship with him that she wants him to have, only to become annoyed again when Sensei refuses to play her game, and Maya tries to shoo him out the door, tired of talking to him. Sensei asks one final question despite her protests - regardless of the circumstances, would she ever want to get to know him? Maya replies in the negative, and Sensei heads home to go to bed.",
