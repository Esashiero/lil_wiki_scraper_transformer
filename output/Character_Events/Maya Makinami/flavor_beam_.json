        "synopsis": "Sensei visits Maya , hoping that he doesn’t have to carry a box this time . Maya explains that she is exhausted, making him wonder if she is still the original Maya, since the possibility of her changing came up recently . She confirms that she is still the original and that she’s just tired. He asks what he could do to help her getting her energy back. Maya, since being left alone doesn’t seem to be an option, allows him to accompany her to get something to eat. He assumes that she guides him to the Takoyaki stall again , but she has something else in mind. She recommends him to hide his wallet, though, since the place she wants to visit is dangerous for people like him. The place turns out to be a maid cafe. Sensei wonders why she brought him here, but she makes it clear that he just followed her here and that he is going to pay her bill as an admission fee. Not surprised by that he accepts her condition. He wants to know if she visits the cafe on a regular basis, which she confirms stating that the portions served are both sizable and cheap. She also admits liking maids, but when Sensei requests to hear that out-of-character line again, she refuses. A maid introducing herself as Uta annoys Maya by calling her princess, arrives at their table and, as soon as she notices him, starts flirting with Sensei. He immediately proposes to her which she shuts down in a heartbeat as marrying customers is prohibited. After having to witness this Maya orders one serving of omurice, some black tea and to not be called a princess for the night, threatening to never come again if Uta doesn’t do the latter. Uta, while displeased with that, accepts her order and tries to persuade Sensei to buy some desserts. Sensei, as a result of her flirting, orders every single dessert, much to her delight and Maya’s expectations. Once Uta leaves, Maya states that she expected him to fall for her but not to this extreme and with this level of gullibility. Sensei clarifies that he is aware that he is being exploited but is willing to pay any amount of money to see a smile like Uta’s. When Maya points out that Ami wouldn’t like to hear that, he begs Maya to never let her know, which she has no intention to do since this means admitting that they spent time together. Sensei asks Maya if she would consider working as a Maid herself. She vehemently rejects this since wearing two complicated dresses and having to act like that would be irritating. As the conversation comes to an end, Uta hands Maya her meal, informs Sensei that his order will need more time, and casts a \"Flavor Beam\" to make Maya’s meal more enjoyable. Sensei wants to know why she puts up with this when she seems to be annoyed by it and can cook something instead. She admits that she can’t cook but, when offered by him, she wouldn’t mind eating Ami’s cooked meals as long as both Sensei and her are eating in separate rooms. By the time Sensei's food arrives, Maya's finished with her meal and forces him to box up all his to take home. The two return home, with Sensei wishing he could've spoken longer to Uta.",
