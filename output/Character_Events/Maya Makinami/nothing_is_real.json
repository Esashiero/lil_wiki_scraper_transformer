She replies that she actually needs him to fail somewhat, and that she has has less ability to change things than he thinks (being, of course, a normal teenage girl). She asks Sensei whether a world containing people who are \"identical copies equipped with altered minds\" is still the same world, and tells him that \"this isn't a game\". He says that he doesn't think it is, and that the progress he has made with people is real. When he adds that she feels real, she says that she is \"tired of hearing that line\", which is \"all part of the cycle\". She ends the conversation by telling him that he'll be needed to carry more boxes sometime.",
