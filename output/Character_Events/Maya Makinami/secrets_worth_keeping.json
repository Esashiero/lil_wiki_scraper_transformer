        "synopsis": "Sensei arrives in the first floor dorm hallway and knocks on Maya 's door... and then has to do so two more times without saying anything before Maya opens the door. She carries a box out, immediately pawning it off on him while lamenting his mere presence. He tries to see if he can open the box, only to be vehemently denied, and Maya goes off into a tangent about Sensei like she is wont to do when around him. He manages to momentarily surprise her by replying to a rhetorical questions with a remarkably philosophical reply about everyone having their own secrets to keep. When Sensei belatedly realizes Maya intends on going elsewhere with the box in tow, he tries and fails to muster the courage to open the box, and Maya, satisfied with having predicted that exact outcome, tells him to follow with the box. The two start making their way toward the school, making idle discussion over the contents of the box and Sensei wondering why they have to go to the school in the middle of the night. The two arrive in front of a door, and Maya, commenting on Sensei's seeming lack of strength, asks for the box, before disappearing for a short time. After leaving the school and a long, awkward silence between the two, Maya invites Sensei to get a drink from a nearby vending machine as payback for his labor. The two lean up against a wall while Sensei takes a sip - the drink oddly reminds him of something, though he cannot place the origin. After a bit of banter and discussion over the different things that enthusiasts can pursue in the world, Sensei kills the beverage and the two leave. Maya parts ways silently at the dorm, and Sensei heads home to go to bed.",
