He's soon approached by a girl named Amy , and she takes him on a tour of the mall they've found themselves in. After stumbling around for a long time, Sensei eventually decides to return home, much to Amy's disappointment. She at first tries to dissuade him, but when he remains adamant on his decision, she relents, asking him to at least promise he'll love \"his side\" of the world as much as he can. Amy leads Sensei to one of the rooms they passed earlier, pushing him into a strange hole in the world. Snapping out of his trance, Sensei finds himself back on \"his side\", with Ami in front of him, concerned as he's been standing in place for a long time. Wordlessly, he tackles Ami, bringing her into a hug.",
