        "synopsis": "The class' teacher begins her lesson, asking the class about happiness, and what sorts of things make them happy. Ami is first to answer, naming snacks made by her father as something that makes her happy. Maya speaks up, trying to express some complexity on the issue, but the teacher ignores her and continues with her lesson. Summoning a series of items in front of everyone, she asks the class to see if they can come up with ways to be happy with them. Ami's at a loss for what to do, but with some encouragement from the teacher, decides to try her best. Meanwhile, Sensei , having remained silent so far, is similarly confused. The teacher offers to help him personally, hopping in front of him to assist. Now uncomfortable, Sensei asks to go home, but the teacher encourages him to stay and keep doing his best. The narrator chimes in, finishing the teacher's lessons: Some people are desperate to be happy, and some people simply aren't meant to be happy. Therefore, it's better to smile regardless -- It's better to construct elaborate facades of happiness for yourself and lock away how you truly feel because otherwise people would find you uncomfortable to be around. Outside the classroom, Sensei applies what he learned in class. All the while, Ami stares vacantly at him.",
