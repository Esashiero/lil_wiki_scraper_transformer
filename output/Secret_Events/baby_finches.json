The world goes strange. Maya wants to talk about how baby finches are sometimes eaten by their parents if they aren't developing well enough. She says that she and Sensei would be the same if they ever had kids. She starts to say that baby finches might be able to get their revenge sometimes, but isn't sure it would work. Ami seems to be in the background. Maya says that male finches might kill baby finches \"just so it can get them out of the nest\" and mate again. Sensei has some numerical thoughts about memory versus dreams, which Maya finds distracting. Sensei mentions being watched, and Maya talks about the god with roots. They cycle back around and repeat themselves. Ami looks less happy now. Sensei says that he was in the middle of something, and Maya asks what could be more important than spending time with his girlfriend. Sensei says that she isn't his girlfriend, and never was. He leaves, and is once again looking at the cool rectangle machine .",
